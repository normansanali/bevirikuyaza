I prayed for this life.”</p><p>As for the rapper, he posted a photo of his newborn holding his finger, writing, “These past 24 hrs have been an adventure to say the least!! I’m a part of the #girldad club now. Perfection is here.”</p><p>The Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood star added on his Instagram Story: “Sorry to everyone who came out to see me in Rhode Island last night but as I was getting ready to leave my wife’s water broke. … Unbelievable.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in October that the couple were <a href=#>expecting their first child together</a>. (The reality star previously gave birth to her son, King, 12, with her ex-boyfriend <strong>Raul Conde</strong> in 2007.)</p><p>“I’m nervous,” Samuels said in his E! reveal at the time. “I’m in shock. I’m in disbelief. It’s very surreal to me. I don’t know what to do but I know I’m going to be great at what I do because I’m great at everything.”</p><p>The pair have been open about their plans to start a family. Mena admitted in a March 2019 Instagram Live video that she was eating “sea moss” to better her chances of getting pregnant.</p><p>She explained at the time: “We’re trying to have a baby, so we’re putting it inside our drinks and stuff.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Six months earlier, the “Hunnid” rapper tweeted, “I’m so serious when I say the next woman I have sex with will be my wife. I can go ages without sex, I don’t care about it. I’m looking for a wife. I want a relationship, something real. If you’re not trying to give that I’ll keep my meat wrapped around my leg 2myself.&nbsp;I already spend a lot of time alone so abstinence will not be a problem at all. This birthday made me realize something and I refuse to grow old and not have a mini me and some1 to share this wood with.”</p><p>He and Mena<a href=#> tied the knot in October 2019</a> in New Jersey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaeqpmYrm65xKeYZp%2BZq7K0ecGiqa2gXam8bn7NnWScoJmhsW590q1ksKGknXq0rcWaqZ6dXaiursHEpapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
