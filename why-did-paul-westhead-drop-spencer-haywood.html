Haywood was a drug addict who was on the brink of a violent death. He was a member of a Detroit gang and once plotted to kill Westhead. His mother, however, dissuaded him and he went on to become an inner-city real estate businessman. His foundation helps inner-city youths, including the disadvantaged, succeed.</p><p>After signing with the Knicks, Haywood failed to connect with his teammates and failed to straighten out the franchise, which was veering away from its glory years of the 1970s. Haywood met his future wife, supermodel Iman, in Atlanta, and the couple married. Their daughter was born, and Haywood went on to have four more children. Sadly, he later developed an addiction to cocaine while in New York, and eventually he was dropped from the Knicks and traded to the Jazz and Lakers.</p><h2><span id=His_relationship_with_Paul_Westhead>His relationship with Paul Westhead</span></h2><p>During the 1980 NBA Finals, Spencer Haywood was suspended after passing out at practice after an exhausting night of freebasing. He later argued with teammates Jim Chones and Brad Holland and eventually lost his job with the Lakers. Westhead was furious with Haywood and suspended him after Game 3.</p><p>Haywood blamed his teammates for his poor performance and sank into drugs and depression. Westhead and his teammates gave him only 25 percent of his playoff check, which he later admitted was to save his life. The former Olympian was earning $ 500,000 per year and using cocaine at an estimated rate of $300 a day. His mother threatened to turn him in, and the Lakers won the championship that year.</p><h2><span id=Why_Did_Paul_Westhead_Drop_Spencer_Haywood_Were_They_Friends_in_Real_Life>Why Did Paul Westhead Drop Spencer Haywood? Were They Friends in Real Life?</span></h2><p>Spencer Haywood and Paul Westhead had a turbulent relationship on and off the court. Haywood’s use of cocaine led to his suspension during the 1980 NBA Finals and the Lakers’ decision to fire him. Although Haywood said he had no intention of hurting Westhead, he later admitted to doing drugs and had even considered killing him. As a result, Westhead suspended Haywood for one season and then fired him after Game 3.</p><p>Haywood, who was a member of the Lakers in the 79-80 season, confessed to using crack cocaine. He told of how the drug affected his playing style and his attitude, and how he fell asleep during a team workout. He was later suspended after Game 3 of the NBA Finals. Nevertheless, the Lakers did win six games without Haywood. They were also sued by his mother and he lost the rights to his former teammates’ photos and videotapes.</p><h2><span id=His_marriage_to_model_Iman>His marriage to model Iman</span></h2><p>Haywood is the owner of a real estate company in Detroit and the founder of a foundation that funds basketball and educational summer camps for inner-city youth. His divorce from model Iman Westhead was blamed on his drug use. He has been clean since 1985 and runs a foundation that helps children. He also says that he regrets missing out on opportunities to play basketball with the Knicks. His marriage to Westhead was short-lived.</p><h2><span id=His_loyalty_to_Paul_McKinney>His loyalty to Paul McKinney</span></h2><p>Fans will be thrilled to learn that Spencer Haywood’s loyalty to Paul Mckinney is still intact in this season’s second half. After all, it was the legendary football coach who inspired many to take up the game. McKinney is an extremely talented player and Westhead does his best to match his brilliance. While McKinney is the team’s star player, Haywood is the most popular player.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding Haywood, his career has been nothing short of a triumph. In addition to his Olympic Gold Medal, Haywood was named to the NBA All-Stars four times. The rumor surrounding Haywood’s self-circumcision has also been a topic of conversation. It’s a bit of a surprise to learn that Spencer Haywood had circumcised himself as a child. His brother had persuaded him to do so in order to prevent him from going insane and becoming a victim of his own insanity. However, it is important to note that Haywood did not boast about his self-circumcision in the dressing room.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMPHsmSdoZRivaLBy2aunquknbKisIydqaioXai9prrCnqlmoJGuxLC7w2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
