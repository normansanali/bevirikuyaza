In the new issue of <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> (out now), the 40-year-old actress opens up about her series of botched boob jobs — and why she decided to show them off in Playboy.</p><p>"When I was 19, a doctor put in bigger implants than what I asked for. I was in such a hurry to get them that I didn't research my doctor," Richards says. "I just thought because they're a plastic surgeon, they must be good. You have to be your advocate for your own body and ask 100 questions."</p><p>When she met with another surgeon to have them corrected, the doctor gave her even larger implants. "I felt very vulnerable," she tells <strong>Us</strong>. "I was getting ready to film [1998's] Wild Things, and I didn't want to get into a lawsuit with some plastic surgeon. It wasn't right what the doctor did, but it is what it is."</p><p>So why did the Real Girl Next Door author decide to doff her top for Playboy in 2004? "A couple reasons: I wanted to encourage women that it's OK to embrace your sexuality even though you're a mom," Richards explains. "At the same time, I was having some problems in my marriage [to <strong>Charlie</strong> <strong>Sheen</strong>] and I didn't feel sexy and felt I had to prove something."</p><p>The Blue Mountain State actress — who recently adopted 6-week-old daughter Eloise Joni — adds that she's happy with her current breast size.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"This is the size I wanted them to look at 19! There's a long investment with breast implants. They're not going to last a lifetime and things can go wrong," she tells <strong>Us</strong>. "I'm happy with them now, but in a year that could change."</p><p>For more revelations from Richards — including her tumultuous relationship with Sheen, her mother's battle with cancer, her decision to adopt, and much, much more — pick up the new issue of <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, out now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGadnZ6ewKZ50aKaoZmimcBuw8eyZKJlopq0s7HTZqSyZZKkvKN5yaiZrGViZX5yfpdwZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
