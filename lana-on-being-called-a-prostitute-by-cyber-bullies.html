It wasn’t the only WWE wedding in the last ten years, but it was certainly the most recent.</p><p>The Ravishing Russian is very good at accepting attention at this point. Some of it might not be very welcomed, especially from cyber bullies. While speaking to <a href=#>TV Insider</a>, Lana revealed what kind of eye opening experience she’s had after this angle started.</p><p>Fans have berated her with comments calling her a prostitute, slut, and pretty much anything else you can imagine. None of those things are okay to call someone who is essentially playing a role on a television show.</p><p>“It has been eye-opening to me how mean people are and what type of bullies people are in the world. I can’t express enough of how mind-blowing it is. People don’t have to agree with my decisions in life, that’s fine, but if they don’t agree with me that doesn’t give them the right to come on my Instagram and call me a whore or a slut.”</p><p>“I’ve been called a prostitute on there. What are you even talking about, really? That I’m ‘ugly, fat, the worst human.’ Cyber-bullying is incredible. I knew it existed, but I never really thought it was to this extent. It’s really wrong.”</p><p>“I just want people to make a stand and say that is wrong. Just because you disagree with someone’s lifestyle doesn’t mean that you should come and be mean to them in life or on social media. Go talk to your friends about it if you are criticizing, but don’t come on my social platform and talk about it.”</p><p><a href=#>Lana and Bobby Lashley have also opened up in the past about receiving death threats because of this angle.</a></p><p>WWE fans take the product very seriously. One thing is for sure, the insults and how much they hurt is very real to Lana. Thankfully, it seems like she has a good enough perspective on the situation so it doesn’t bother her as much as it might others.</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
