BruceDropEmOff has garnered 1.3 million Twitch followers in the last few years but got banned from the platform three times in 2023 alone.</p><p>Bruce's Twitch channel is now inaccessible and displays one of the San Francisco-based platform's several ban notifications. The message says, "This channel is temporarily unavailable due to a violation of Twitch's Community Guidelines or Terms of Service." Earlier he was banned on January 27 and March 1.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Kai Cenat threatens to leave Twitch 'for good'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>5 banned streamers on Twitch who can possibly move to Kick</a></p><h2 class=split>Why was BruceDropEmOff banned from Twitch?</h2><p>BruceDropEmOff's latest ban comes just days after making some contentious comments on broadcast while talking to rapper DDG. The former OTK streamer has a history of being vocal about his beliefs, getting banned from the Amazon-owned platform for using racist insults such as the C-word.</p><p>The streamer is yet to address the Twitch ban in public. Although Bruce did not comment on the possibility, Twitch star <a href=#>Kai Cenat</a> recently stated that if he received another ban from the platform, he would leave the purple app. Following this ban and the recent conversation with Kai, many Bruce fans are urging him to move to Trainwreck's streaming platform, Kick, where an account bearing his name has already been verified.</p><h2 class=split>'Twitch aint Playin'</h2><p>Although the reason for the recent ban has not been revealed, fans have expressed their support for BruceDropEmOff. Some, however, are shocked that he has been suspended again. One user wrote, “Is it a matter of incorrectly enforced rules, or just big streamers refusing to follow them?” Another user tweeted, “Didn’t he just say how much he loved Twitch?” “Left right and centre, Twitch aint Playin,” yet another user said.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Is it a matter of incorrectly enforced rules, or just big streamers refusing to follow them?</p>— Fizz-sama (@FizzAgain) <a href=#>May 3, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Didn’t he just say how much he loved Twitch?</p>— MikeyPerk (@mikeyperk) <a href=#>May 3, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Left right and centre, Twitch aint Playin</p>— Swypa (@Swypaa) <a href=#>May 3, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
