His parents were born in Brazil, but they eventually moved to the United States “in search of the American dream.”</p><p style=color:#252525>Mr. Santos also said that he went to New York City’s Baruch College before becoming a “seasoned Wall Street financier and investor” who had worked at prestigious companies like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.</p><p style=color:#252525>Mr. Santos also said that he “worked hard” to get 13 properties and that his mother was “in her office in the South Tower” of the World Trade Center on September 11. His campaign’s website said as recently as October that she had lived through the attack but died a few years later.</p><p style=color:#252525>With his victory in November, Mr. Santos became the first openly gay Republican to win a seat in the House of Representatives as a non-incumbent. He is still fairly new to politics in the United States.</p><p>Let’s Talk About His Sexuality.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by George Santos (@santos4_congress)</a></p><h2><strong>Is George Santos Gay Or Straight?</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Daily Beast</a> says that Santos, who says he has “never experienced discrimination in the Republican Party,” broke new ground this year when he became the first openly gay non-incumbent GOP candidate to be elected to Congress.</p><p style=color:#252525>But according to court records that the Daily Beast found, Santos seems to be going through a divorce with a woman in Queens County, New York, in September 2019. The divorce, which Santos hasn’t talked about in public, makes his political and biographical claims even less sure.</p><p style=color:#252525>“I am openly gay and have never had a problem with my sexual identity in the last ten years,” Santos told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">USA Today</a> in October in response to criticism about his support for Florida’s “don’t say gay” law, which was signed into law this year by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p><p>It’s possible that Santos, who says he has “never experienced discrimination in the Republican Party,” has been living comfortably as an openly gay man for more than a decade. He says he hasn’t had any problems because of his sexuality.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons why people get married. But Santos’ situation is strange because he never told voters about his divorce and never explained how his previous marriage to a woman, which ended just 12 days before he started his first campaign for Congress, fits with his claims that he is an openly gay Republican.</p><p style=color:#252525>It’s not clear why Santos hasn’t talked about his marriage and divorce, but it doesn’t make sense with what we know about him now.</p><p style=color:#252525>He has told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">U.S.</a> and<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Brazilian</a> media in the past that he was engaged to a man, a fellow Brazilian whom Santos has said is a pharmacist, and that he lives with his husband on Long Island. (The Daily Beast was unable to find any public record of the man’s work in that field or his marriage.)</p><p><strong>Read More</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Who Is Meadow Rain Walker?
