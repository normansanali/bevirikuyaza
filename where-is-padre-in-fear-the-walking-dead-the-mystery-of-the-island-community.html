The Mystery of the Island Community</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is PADRE?</h2><p>PADRE is a mysterious organization that has been mentioned several times in the seventh and eighth seasons of Fear the Walking Dead, the spin-off series of The Walking Dead. PADRE stands for <strong>P</strong>roject <strong>A</strong>lpha <strong>D</strong>elta <strong>R</strong>ecovery <strong>E</strong>ffort, a classified operation by the U.S. government to create a safe-zone on an island in the event of a societal collapse. According to sitename CBR, PADRE was founded by Major General Krennick of the U.S. Army, who used hundreds of shipping containers filled with supplies to build a fortress on the island. PADRE’s initial purpose was to use the supplies to help rebuild the world and establish trading partners with other survivors.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where is PADRE located?</h2><p>The exact location of PADRE has been a debatable mystery since Season 7, as different characters have different clues and theories about it. Alicia initially thought that PADRE was Padre Island in Texas, but Will, a former PADRE member, told her that the location was too obvious and that PADRE was somewhere else. In the Season 7 finale, Madison, who was rescued by PADRE, gave the coordinates of the island community as 31° 51’ N, 81° 10’ W. This places PADRE on Ossabaw Island in Savannah, Georgia, not far from the filming location of Fort James Jackson. According to sitename Screen Rant, PADRE’s location in Georgia also explains how Morgan was able to make a quick trip to King County, the fictional county where Rick Grimes used to live, to get a cure for Grace’s bite.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why does PADRE steal kids?</h2><p>One of the most disturbing aspects of PADRE is that they have been kidnapping children from other communities and bringing them to the island. The reason for this is not entirely clear, but it seems that PADRE has a sinister agenda behind their actions. According to sitename The Cinemaholic, PADRE may be stealing kids to use them as soldiers, workers, or experiments, as they believe that children are the future of humanity and that they need to be protected and trained by PADRE. PADRE may also be trying to create a cult-like atmosphere on the island, where the children are indoctrinated with PADRE’s ideology and loyalty. Whatever the case, PADRE’s actions have caused a lot of anger and resentment among the other survivors, especially Troy and Madison, who have lost their children to PADRE.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfrLWmvsRmoKxloJaxs7GMoqVmnpWWv27Ax55ksJmcoLavs4ydnJqcXam1pnnMsqqtnaKuerCyjK2fnmWZqLmiusNmmqilnaq7qsDYaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
