Last December, rapper <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Drakeo the Ruler</a>, </strong>28, was stabbed during a fight at a music festival. Rapper <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pop Smoke</strong></a>, 20, was shot to death in a home invasion in February 2020. Fans will also remember that rapper <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nipsey Hussle</strong></a>, 33, was shot and killed outside his clothing store in March 2019. None of the incidents are believed to be connected.</p><h2>Half Ounce was married</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>It’s been confirmed that Half Ounce was on the phone with his wife when he was murdered.
