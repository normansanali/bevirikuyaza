The TV star explained to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun</a> that he had simply taken a break to undergo surgery, but as of 2021, he had not been invited back.</p><p id=eF-9DADBqlT data-wc=42>"It's up to the network whether I come back on the show. It ain't gonna affect me one bit. I didn't leave the show," he began. "I finished shooting and then I had a little back surgery and then the pandemic came."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2fae3ee4880f-frank-fritz-red-carpet-2012.jpg><p id=e1vI2eG0Onl data-wc=23>By July of that year, however, his co-host Mike Wolfe confirmed that Frank would not be returning to for season 22.</p><p id=ervQwQhJdJj data-wc=61>Posting a behind-the-scenes photo on Instagram, Mike noted: "I have known Frank for as long as I can remember, he's been like a brother to me. The journey that Frank, Dani [Danielle Colby] and I started back in 2009, like all of life, has come with its highs and lows, blessings and challenges, but it has also been the most rewarding."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/242000654202-american-pickers-stars-frank-fritz-and-mike-wolfe.jpg><p id=e1oj-INwVqn data-wc=31>Mike concluded: "I will miss Frank, just like all of you, and I pray for the very best and all good things for him on the next part of his journey."</p><p id=eucPiA01Q- data-wc=30>Around the time of Mike's statement, reports of a rift between the TV personalities had already begun circulating, fuelled by Frank's revelation that there had been tensions behind the scenes.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=erPCUwazpMx data-wc=38>"I haven't talked to Mike in two years. He knew my back was messed up, but he didn't call me up and ask how I was doing. That's just how it is," he explained to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun</a>.</p><p id=eTaVWSzQ9Fb data-wc=62>"The show is tilted towards him 1,000 percent. I can't even bend that far down to show you how much," added Frank. "That's fine. It's like you've got Aerosmith and there's Steven Tyler and he's the front man. I found my spot, I'm second and he's number one on the show. That's no problem with me, maybe he does have a problem."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Read more</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Who is Mark Harmon's wife Pam Dawber and who does she play on NCIS?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/30b58101c7b8-ncis-pam-dawber-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Who is Mark Harmon's wife Pam Dawber and who does she play on NCIS?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Who is Mark Harmon's wife Pam Dawber and who does she play on NCIS?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="‘Genuinely amazing’: viewers saying same thing about gripping new sci-fi drama Fallout" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0d0c99897456-fallouts1ut221201whijoj00058rc-e3000.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="‘Genuinely amazing’: viewers saying same thing about gripping new sci-fi drama Fallout" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>‘Genuinely amazing’: viewers saying same thing about gripping new sci-fi drama Fallout</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd reveals family's reaction to real-life stalker drama" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/402b8adf5215-richard-gadd-baby-reindeer.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd reveals family's reaction to real-life stalker drama" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd reveals family's reaction to real-life stalker drama</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eNRzW5ncD1P data-wc=53>Reflecting on Mike's Instagram statement a month later, Frank even told that he doubted the 59-year-old had penned it. "Somebody wrote it out for him. I don't believe in ten years he's said five nice things to me, you know? Unless he was cutting somebody else down and we were both laughing."</p><p id=eu9xOdlj3Gc data-wc=21>Mike eventually responded to Frank's comments, suggesting that the star's struggles with alcohol addiction had played a part in their feud.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5a238f6a84df-frank-fritz-mike-wolfe-red-carpet.jpg><p id=eVPcWKz6ZfX data-wc=62>"We all do care about Frank and we want him back on the show. I would love to talk with him again, we would absolutely love to, but he just can't get it right," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun</a>. Frank is just going through a lot personally with addictions. It's unfortunate that he's made decisions that have him the way he is."</p><p id=evbqjgmrYVv data-wc=25>In July 2022, Frank was found unresponsive in his home after experiencing a stroke. Taking to Instagram, Mike wished his former co-star a full recovery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ed5edab77b1a-frank-fritz-smiling-close-up.jpg><p id=eWCXYhQGcU7 data-wc=58>"I have been very private in the past year in regards to Franks's life and the journey he's been on. There has been lots of opinions in regards to mine and Frank's friendship and the show but now is not the time to set the record straight. Now is the time to pray for my friend," he began.</p><p id=eszan8kkvpz data-wc=35>"Frank has suffered a stroke and is in the hospital. Please keep him in your hearts and thoughts. Frank I pray more than anything that you make it through this okay. I love you buddy."</p><p id=eYGxhcfwaqD data-wc=51>By May 2023, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Quad-City Times</a> had reported that Mike had visited Frank in the hospital with the two putting their differences aside. Focused on his recovery, Frank is yet to return to American Pickers, although fans have remained hopeful that might make a comeback on the show someday.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
