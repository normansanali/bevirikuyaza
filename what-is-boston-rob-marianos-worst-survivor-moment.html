At the time, Trump said NBC wouldn't have an adult star. Daniels revealed that Trump personally called her, and revealed it wasn't his casting idea. Trump went on to tell Daniels she'd be a better fit for the show. On the contrary, Jameson spoke highly of her experience on The Apprentice, and even credited Donald Trump for giving her some sound advice.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/donald-trump-the-apprentice.png></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> 1 day ago<h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Who is the most lovable Top Chef competitor ever?">Who is the most lovable Top Chef competitor ever?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>When Top Chef’s Fabio Viviani was competing on Top Chef, it was abundantly clear that he took his food and the competition very seriously. However, there is no denying that when Viviani smiled, he came across as such a friendly and kind person that he quickly became extremely lovable. On top of that, Viviani had such a mischievous and fun personality that most fans couldn’t help but root for him.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> 1 day ago<h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Which Dancing with the Star celebrity was the most ridiculous inclusion?">Which Dancing with the Star celebrity was the most ridiculous inclusion?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>During the 29th season of Dancing with the Stars, Carole Baskin from The Tiger King was partnered with Pasha Pashkov. While there have been several controversial celebrities who’ve performed on Dancing with the Stars, there are two reasons why Baskin’s inclusion was the most ridiculous. First off, The Tiger King portrayed Baskin as a villain so her inclusion was going to turn off some people. More importantly, even though The Tiger King was a sensation after it was released, people moved on from the show surprisingly quickly. As a result, most people didn’t really care about Baskin by the time she appeared on Dancing with the Stars.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/top-chef-s-fabio-viviani-smiling.jpg></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> 1 day ago<h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Who is the biggest celebrity reality TV fan?">Who is the biggest celebrity reality TV fan?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>There are a number of A-list celebrities who claim to be addicted to reality TV. This could mean Bravo shows, Netflix dating shows, or even those TLC projects that garner so much controversy. Among the biggest names who are self-professed reality TV fans are Howard Stern, Jessica Chastain, Julia Roberts, Michael Rappaport, Meghan McCain, Jon Hamm, Julia Roberts, Nicki Minaj, Meryl Streep, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, and Lady Gaga.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> Jun 26, 2024<h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What was Jeff Probst's worst moment as Survivor's showerunner and executive producer?">What was Jeff Probst's worst moment as Survivor's showerunner and executive producer?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>After hosting Survivor for years, Jeff Probst took a lot of control over the show when he was named the showrunner and executive producer. While Probst made a lot of great decisions in those roles, something he did was pretty egregious. After Dan Spilo was accused of inappropriate touching, he was allowed to stay in the game for many days since the affected person didn’t ask for him to be eliminated. Probst’s worst decision as Survivor’s showrunner was to not take control of the situation himself. After all, it was Probst’s responsibility to decide what should happen to Spilo and to keep the players safe.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/carole-baskin-from-dancing-with-the-stars.jpg></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> Jun 27, 2024<h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What is the most baffling part of Storage Wars?">What is the most baffling part of Storage Wars?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>During each episode of Storage Wars, the buyers walk by the most recently opened locker and examine what they see from feet away. It is at this point that the most baffling part of Storage Wars happens. While it is ridiculous that the show takes the buyers’ random estimates of value seriously, the most baffling thing is how the buyers explain what they like about the lockers. After all, the buyers will sometimes say the most random things including that they like how mysterious a locker seems or that it is a good sign that there is so much dust.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> 1 day ago<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaqVlrFww8eaq2aho2KvsL%2FTqKVmqp%2BXeq6t0aKYp6ejYsSwvtKtZKytoqu2t7vRZqSopZWjwXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
