Although, in this case, their families actually really like each other, which is why Ginny and Marcus can’t be together.</p><p>As the first season of <a href=#>Ginny & Georgia</a> progresses, the chemistry between Marcus and Ginny only grows, as do the stakes around them. Ginny’s friends are going through their own personal disasters as Ginny’s boyfriend, Hunter (Mason Temple), the less enthralling point of the love triangle, plays “oppression Olympics” with her. On top of it all, Ginny’s family life unravels as a detective comes close to discovering that Ginny’s mother, Georgia (Brianne Howey), has murdered not one, but two men.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Marcus gets into an accident that could have led to him dying in ‘Ginny & Georgia.’</h2><p>When Marcus climbs into Ginny’s window only to find her self-harming, he becomes concerned, but he professes his love to Ginny, hoping this will ease her emotional pain. Ginny, on the other hand, is completely distracted and riled up from walking in on her mother sleeping with her father (which doesn’t sound so strange, but their on-again-off-again tumultuous relationship has haunted Ginny her entire life).</p><p>Ginny lashes out at Marcus (she is a 16-year-old girl after all), spitting to him, “I can’t believe I was so into you, always lurking outside my window like a loser … Your problem is that you’re incapable of anything real. You’re a joke. Now get out.” She continues to yell at him to leave as he tears up, and the saddest part is that we can empathize with both of them.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcus</a> leaves and jumps onto his motorcycle, which he does not yet know how to ride. Then we hear a crash. Luckily, we find out in the next episode that Marcus does not die from his motorcycle crash, although he comes away with an incredibly severe concussion.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Marcus doesn’t die in ‘Ginny & Georgia,’ but who does die?</h2><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">death is one of Ginny & Georgia’s</a> underlying themes that haunts Georgia throughout the entire show, we don’t actually see anyone die during the present-day plot. However, in Georgia’s past, death is inescapable. We find out early on that Georgia murdered her most recent husband, who she caught inappropriately touching Ginny, and we learned that’s what the Miller family is running from.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Later, we learn that Georgia also killed her first husband, who she had to marry in order to win back Ginny from social services, and he was also clearly a leper. Although Georgia had reason to kill, that still makes her incredibly dangerous, which is why Ginny runs in the season finale. This also sets up more potential deaths in the series. If Georgia had the ability to kill twice (that we know of), who’s to say she won’t kill again?&nbsp;</p><p>Ginny & Georgia is available to stream on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ymmKubpah6pbXEZqCnZZeeu6%2FFjJqlnWWXmryzs8ia</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
