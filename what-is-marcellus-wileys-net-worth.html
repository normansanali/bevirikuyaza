Either way, Wiley’s had a successful career in the spotlight, and as a result, he’s accumulated quite a net worth.</p><p data-characters=654 data-current-count=961 data-injectable=true>In Nov. 2023, however, Wiley’s name came up for another, much more troubling reason: In a civil lawsuit, the former athlete and media personality was accused of rape by a classmate at Columbia University in 1994, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>. The plaintiff in the case — who is unidentified in the press — alleges that Wiley sexually assaulted her several times while they were both enrolled at the school. The Ivy League institution was also named in the suit. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff told the administration what happened, but disciplinary action was taken against Wiley for purported academic issues rather than assault accusations.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a>, after the alleged Wiley attack, the plaintiff became involved with the Columbia University chapter of Take Back the Night, where she met other women who said they were sexually assaulted by Wiley while at the New York university. One of them also said the administrators at Columbia covered up their accusations to mitigate negative publicity for the school and its sports program.</p><h2 id=h-wiley-s-worth-around-5-million data-injectable=false>Wiley’s worth around $5 million</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=781 data-injectable=true>As for Marcellus Wiley’s net worth, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a> says he’s worth around $5 million with an estimated annual income of $350,000. The website says Wiley made most of his money playing football. After college, he played for several NFL teams, including the Buffalo Bills, the San Diego Chargers, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The pro-bowler retired from the sport in 2006 and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">never won a Super Bowl ring</a>. He then was an analyst for ESPN and FS1.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>On his Brinx.Tv show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wiley admitted sexual contact with the plaintiff while in school but denied the rape accusations. </a>The lawsuit comes on the eve of the 2022 New York Survivors Act one-year window closing, allowing civil litigation to move forward on sexual assault claims despite the statute of limitations having expired.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">US Weekly</a>, Wiley married AnneMarie Wiley in 2014, and the couple have three children.
