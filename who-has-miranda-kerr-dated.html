Still, none meant as much for her career as Victoria's Secret did. She remained an Angel for seven years, during which she entered Hollywood, and made a name for herself. Miranda Kerr said goodbyes to both her Victoria's Secret contract and her ex-husband, Orlando Bloom, in 2013.</p><p>It's said that Miranda has kept her personal (and dating) life very private since then, specifically because of who she has been dating.</p><h2 id=miranda-kerr-39-s-career-let-her-meet-many-famous-people>Miranda Kerr's Career Let Her Meet Many Famous People</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/untitled-design-63.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miranda Kerr has come a long way from her small-town upbringing in Australia to her lavish lifestyle as a celebrity in Los Angeles. With a modeling career that made her name famous globally and a successful skincare line, Miranda Kerr has established herself as one of the most influential figures in the fashion and beauty industries.</p><p>Also, she made sure to keep a low profile throughout the years, and always directs the media to focus on her work rather than on her personal life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Orlando Bloom's Ex Miranda Kerr Talks About Her First Impression Of Katy Perry</a></span></p><p>But before she became a household name, <a href=#>Miranda Kerr had a quiet life in a small town</a> in New South Wales, Australia. As a child, she was quite adventurous, always outdoors climbing trees, or swimming in the river.</p><p>She recalled several times during interviews how living in a small town made her feel like they all had an extended family, highlighting the "real sense of community" in Gunnedah.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-has-miranda-kerr-dated-mostly-millionaires>Who Has Miranda Kerr Dated?

From Hollywood actors to tech billionaires, Miranda Kerr has been linked to several notable names throughout her career.</p><p>Her most publicized relationship was with Orlando Bloom, with whom she welcomed a child, Flynn. Since Orlando Bloom was already a famous actor, and she was still a successful Angel at Victoria's Secret, a lot of media attention was on their marriage.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside Katy Perry & Miranda Kerr's Friendship</a></span></p><p>The couple appeared to be happy and in love, with Miranda Kerr often speaking publicly about her admiration for Bloom and their strong bond as a family. However, in October 2013, they announced that they had separated after three years of marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few years after, Miranda Kerr married Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel. Until she found love again, Miranda Kerr looked for some time. At some point during 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an Asian billionaire was reportedly "showering" Miranda Kerr</a> with diamond jewelry.</p><p>Even if Miranda Kerr had tried to keep this controversial relationship to herself, that wasn't possible because an investigation revealed that the Asian billionaire bought the gifts with stolen money.</p><h2 id=fans-think-her-career-might-be-affected-by-her-dating-life>Fans Think Her Career Might Be Affected By Her Dating Life</h2><p>This wasn't the first time that Miranda Kerr was involved in controversial relationships. No matter how hard she tried to maintain a clean image, her secret relationships were revealed by the media, and fans weren't happy.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussing Miranda Kerr's controversial affairs with billionaires</a> fans don't see the supermodel being as innocent as she marketed her image throughout the years. Apart from her one-year relationship with the Asian billionaire, it seems that Miranda Kerr found another billionaire in Russia with whom she never appeared in public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Miranda Kerr And Orlando Bloom's Son, Flynn?</a></span></p><p>As a result, fans suspect Miranda Kerr keeps her controversial relationships secret "for fear of her career." Some people even say that Miranda Kerr would surely "drop whoever she talks to" if a richer man walks into a room, concluding that she was always on the lookout for the next rich man.</p><p>"She probably felt she got it made with Evan Spiegel," wrote one fan, referring to her husband as looking good and being young when compared to the "gross/old/out of shape" billionaires she dated before.</p><p>Also, many people insist that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miranda Kerr has a shady side</a> as a result of the diamond scandal, or cheating rumors with Justin Bieber when she was still married to Orlando Bloom.</p><h2 id=her-reputation-might-have-lost-her-a-new-victoria-39-s-secret-contract>Her Reputation Might Have Lost Her A New Victoria's Secret Contract</h2><p>As a result of keeping these controversies secret, and even being involved in them, many fans think she lost her contract with Victoria's Secret due to her difficult reputation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, because of Victoria's Secret which surely gave her the necessary boost to get recognized, Miranda Kerr had a <a href=#>net worth of approximately $60 million in 2020</a> which has surely increased since then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/untitled-design-64.jpg><p>When it comes to the <a href=#>reasons why she is no longer an Angel</a>, both Miranda Kerr and the company have different versions of the story. While Miranda Kerr insisted that she had too many different contracts with other companies, Victoria's Secret wasn't interested in renewing a contract with her because of her reputation.</p><p>Considering fans' opinions on her controversial relationships, and how her famous Angel role vanished, Miranda Kerr probably had good reasons for keeping her dating life private.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddna60ecyiqZqmlJZ6rLHRq2SdmaSasXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
