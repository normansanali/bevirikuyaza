She revealed that she was 20 weeks along back in May 2023 (meaning that she is still pregnant as of writing in August 2023). The news surprised many, and she took the opportunity to share her feelings and thoughts about becoming a mother. In her post, Chrisean expressed both excitement and fear about the journey ahead. She mentioned that the pregnancy was planned, but the relationship with the <a href=# rel>baby's father, Blueface</a>, had changed. This led to a loss of trust between them. Despite the challenges, she affirmed her commitment to caring for her baby with or without Blueface's support.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emotional-ups-downs>Emotional Ups & Downs</h2></span><p>Natalie Nunn and ChriseanRock at the Hollywood Unlocked Impact Awards.
