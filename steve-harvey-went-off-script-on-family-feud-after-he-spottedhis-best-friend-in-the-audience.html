I know what it is to start at the bottom. I know what it is to get back up. I know what it is to overcome. I know what it is to win. I know what losses feel like. I know what failure does â€” I know how to use it to your advantage."</p><p>Despite the ups and downs, it seems like Harvey was able to maintain close friendships along the way, as evidenced by a certain moment on Family Feud.</p><h2 id=steve-harvey-got-emotional-on-family-feud-after-he-spotted-his-best-friend-of-61-years>Steve Harvey Got Emotional On Family Feud After He Spotted His Best Friend Of 61 Years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar47189263.jpg><p>Steve Harvey introduces the Doughty family but suddenly says, "hold on one second," as he makes his way into the audience.
