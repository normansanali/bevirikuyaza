Seawater dehydrates you because the amount of water needed to flush the excess salt from your body would be more than what you drank. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on amnh.org</a><h2>What is the only animal that can drink salt water?</h2>Although people can't drink seawater, some marine mammals (like whales and seals) and seabirds (like gulls and albatrosses) can drink seawater. Marine mammals have super efficient kidneys, and seabirds have a special gland in their nose that removes salt from the blood. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on amnh.org</a><h2>Why Fish Can Drink Salt Water And We Can’t</h2><h2>Which animal never drink water in its lifetime?</h2>Kangaroo rats, according to scientists, are the only animals that can exist without water.

Water enters the mouth, passes over the gills, and exits the body through a special opening.

In most cases, water is supplied by the metabolism of prey proteins (metabolic water) and the oxidation of fat (drinking water). In cetaceans, these waters may be sufficient to maintain a water balance in the body. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on baleinesendirect.org</a><h2>Do dolphins ever get thirsty?</h2>All mammals, including sea mammals, do feel thirst.

Before the water may be consumed, the salt must also be removed and heating the water won't do this permanently. You must employ reverse osmosis or distillation technology to desalinate seawater safely. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on cruiserowaterandpower.com</a><h2>Can I drink rain water?</h2>Rainwater can carry bacteria, parasites, viruses, and chemicals that could make you sick, and it has been linked to disease outbreaks.
