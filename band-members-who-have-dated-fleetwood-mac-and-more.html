Fleetwood Mac is perhaps the most famous example of <a href=#>bandmates dating each other</a> — and the ensuing complications that come with it.</p><p>“I broke up with <a href=#><strong>Lindsey [Buckingham]</strong></a> in 1976. We’d only been in Fleetwood Mac for a year and a half, and we were breaking up when we joined Fleetwood Mac,” <a href=#><strong>Stevie Nicks</strong></a> recalled in a February 2022 conversation with <a href=# rel=noopener>The New Yorker</a>. “So, we just put our relationship kind of back together, because I was smart enough to know that, if we had broken up the second month of being in Fleetwood Mac, it would have blown the whole thing.”</p><p>The Arizona native continued: “I just bided my time, and tried to make everything as easy as possible, tried to be as sweet and nice to Lindsey as I could be. <a href=#>He wasn’t happy, either</a>. Then something happened that was, you know, ‘We’re done.’ And he knew it. It was time. And the band was solid, by that time, so I could walk away knowing that he was safe. And that the band was safe. And that we could work it out.”</p><p>The duo’s <a href=#>breakup provided inspiration</a> for the group’s critically acclaimed 1977 album, Rumours. Nicks and Buckingham penned “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way” about each other for the LP, respectively.</p><p>“Both songs kind of mean the same thing — it’s really about our breakup,” Nicks said. “He’s <a href=#>looking at it from a very unpleasant, angry way</a>, and I’m saying, in my more airy-fairy way, we’re gonna be all right. We’ll get through this.”</p><p>Other bandmates’ relationships have stood the test of time. When <a href=#><strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong></a> invited <a href=#><strong>Patti Scialfa</strong></a> to join his E Street Band on tour as a backup singer in 1984, the “Born in the USA” musician was still married to <strong>Julianne Phillips</strong>. Springsteen and Phillips separated in 1998 and the Grammy Award winner began living with Scialfa soon afterward.</p><p>In a 1996 interview with The Advocate, <a href=#>the “Thunder Road” singer opened up</a> about receiving backlash for starting a new relationship before his divorce was finalized.</p><p>“It’s a strange society that <a href=#>assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love</a> and whom they shouldn’t. But the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, ‘Well, all I know is this feels real, and maybe I have got a mess going [on] here in some fashion, but that’s life,’” he told the outlet at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The New Jersey native married Scialfa in 1991. They share three children: <a href=#>Jessica</a>, Evan and Sam.</p><p>Scroll through for a guide to which musicians have dated their bandmates over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr6K6w2aknqWSmr%2B0edahpmagkauybrDArZydZZahsqbA1qimnWWdlrBurc2dZKanopp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
