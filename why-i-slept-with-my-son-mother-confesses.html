The woman said her in-laws threatened to kick her out of the house due to her inability to give birth.</p><p>She told The Nation: “We had been married for more than six years but were still childless due to my husband’s fault, according to doctor’s report, and I was hearing from the grapevine that he was planning to take a second wife on the grounds that I could not give him a child.”</p><p>“Since he is not comfortable with us going for medical checkups on the assumption that nothing was wrong with him, I decided to convince my little son, who is just about 16 years old and schooling in Akwanga.</p><p>“I visited him regularly. He stays in a private apartment with my relatives, so I was going there to spend some time with them, especially on weekends when my market is off.</p><p>“It was actually difficult making love with my own son, but circumstances forced me to go into it. I needed to be sure of my fertility.</p><p>“I know my husband very well. If he discovered I had an affair with a man outside, he would kill me.</p><p>“I love him so much and I’m afraid of him, so this evil plan kept ringing in my mind to know how fertile I am.</p><p>“I tried to visit my son in Akwanga mostly when I was on my ovulation period. I decided to develop a crush on him and draw him very close to me. We got intimate and ended up having sex.</p><p>“One faithful day while I was on my ovulation period, I visited him. It was at about 11pm. I held his hand and made him sit beside me.</p><p>“I asked him if he had ever had sex and he said no. I held him in my arms. This time, I felt warm and I think he too did.</p><p>“After that night, I felt extremely embarrassed, and guilty that I committed such an abomination with my own son.</p><p>“It was actually a taboo, but I warned him to keep it secret.”</p><p>Source;<a href=#><strong>Ghgossip.com</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfsmWZYsCtsc%2BtZLChpJ16rsWMrKanZZ2kwamx0WaaqKaWmsC0sdJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
