Her contract with IMPACT will expire, and the two sides have not reached a new deal.</p><p>Deonna Purrazzo discussed her free agency with Gabby LaSpisa on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabby AF</a>. She noted that she has had great conversations so far.</p><p>“The last couple weeks have been really interesting because obviously, we’ve seen tons of stuff about my contract status come out on social media, and I’ve not really addressed it too much because I don’t really have anything to say yet,” she said. “I’ve been able to have some really great conversations with people all across the board. The only thing I can say is that I feel validated, and I feel like the work that I’ve been able to put in at IMPACT has really changed the entire trajectory of my career, and the perception of me.</p><p>“Going into IMPACT, I think my time in NXT deemed me a little bit difficult, a little bit outspoken, a little bit maybe cocky or overconfident, and I think that I’ve been able to rehab that image of myself and show people, no, I’m a team player, and yes, of course I want to be the champion and I want to be at the top, but I can also be a champion and handle all the responsibilities that come with that. It’s opened a lot of doors for me, going into free agency. I don’t have an answer. I don’t have any details or anything because I just don’t know yet.”</p><h2 id=h-deonna-purrazzo-the-decision-will-be-very-difficult>Deonna Purrazzo: The Decision Will Be Very Difficult</h2><p>Deonna Purrazzo went on to describe how there are pros and cons with every potential move. She explained that her heart is full of love for IMPACT, so the decision will not be easy.</p><p>“There’s a lot of pros and cons to every place that I could go,” Deonna Purrazzo said. “My heart is so full for IMPACT that whether I stay or go or whatever the case is going to be, it’s not gonna be an easy decision, no matter what my decision is.</p><p>“To stay is to be with my family, and obviously my husband’s there, and I’ve just had the time of my life and the career moments of my life there. But also, I have to weigh is it time to maybe try to do that somewhere else. So it’s very difficult.”</p><p>WrestleZone will provide more information about Deonna Purrazzo’s free agency as it becomes available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsaGxpaGKxprvNp5hmqKWnv6LG2ahkoZmjYrWisIygqZ6ZpGLBorjKrGSam6KkwLR506GcZpqflr%2BlecChnJqcXaSzbrLRnpxmmZeau6TF</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
