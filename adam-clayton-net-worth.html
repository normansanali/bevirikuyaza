As a member of the band he has won more than 20 Grammy Awards, more than 10 Q Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, & BRIT Awards as well as a number of other prestigious awards. Adam Clayton has been active in the entertainment industry since 1976.</p><p>How rich is the musician? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the net worth of Adam Clayton is as much as $150 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2016.</p><h3>Adam Clayton Net Worth $150 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Clayton is the eldest child of Brian, a pilot of the Royal Air Force, and Jo Clayton. When he was five years old, the family moved to Yellow Walls Road in Malahide near Dublin, where his sister Sarah Jane and his brother Sebastian were born. Clayton attended the private boarding school St. Columba’s College, and later matriculated from Mount Temple High School, where he, <a href=#>Bono</a>, <a href=#>The Edge</a> and <a href=#>Larry Mullen Jr.</a> met. It is worth mentioning the fact that Adam did not have any formal music education before 1996.</p><p>He started as the U2 bassist plus band manager before Paul McGuinness took over the latter position. In the middle of the 1980s, the band became known worldwide, because they were appreciated more as live performers by fans than as artists as far as album sales are concerned, until their 1987 album “The Joshua Tree”. During the decade U2 would influence pop, electronics, dance and alternative rock music, but in 2000 U2 again achieved great commercial success with the album “All That You Can Not Leave Behind”, adding significantly to all the band mamber’s net worth including Adam Clayton’s.</p><p>After this album U2 set aside the experimental sounds they produced in the 1990s, becoming more conventional while maintaining their initial musical influences by returning to the sound of their early albums, so much so that they are now one of the musical artists with higher sales, selling approximately 150 million copies worldwide. Overall, U2 has recorded thirteen studio albums, which increased the total size of Adam Clayton and other members net worth. In 2005, the band was inducted in the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>Concerning his career as a musician, on the single “Sunday, Bloody Sunday” (1983) and the b-side song “Endless Deep” (1983) he sings a rare vocal contribution. Adam and Bono participated in the Band Aid charity single “Do They Know It’s Christmas?” (1984); Bono sang and Adam played the bass. Adam Clayton won the best bass player Orville H. Gibson Guitar Award in 2001 and 2002.</p><p>Aside fro U2, Adam played bass on the album of <a href=#>Robbie Robertson</a> called “Robbie Robertson” (1987) and participated in making Maria McKee albums. Adam and <a href=#>Larry Mullen Jr.</a> collaborated in Nanci Griffith’s album “Flyer” recording the songs “These Days in an Open Book”, “Do Not Forget About Me”, “On Grafton Street” and “This Heart”. Clayton and <a href=#>Larry</a> also did the soundtrack for the film “Mission: Impossible”; the theme song “Theme From Mission: Impossible” was also a Grammy nominee as the Best Pop Instrumental Performance.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the musician, Adam Clayton was engaged to super-model <a href=#>Naomi Campbell</a> in 1994, although they split up after 6 months. In 2006 he became engaged to Susie Smith, however, early in the following year they announced their separation. In 2010, Clayton and his longtime French girlfriend had already become parents of a boy, and in 2013, Adam Clayton married Mariana Teixeira De Carvalho.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=26.955267558528><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$150 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 13, 1960</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>April 4, 1972, Miami, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chinnor, Oxfordshire, England, UK</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.78&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>75&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Musician, bass guitarist, songwriter</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>St. Columba's College, Mount Temple Comprehensive School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Irish</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Mariana Teixeira De Carvalho (m. 2013-)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Bria Clayton, Jo Clayton</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Sarah Jane, Sebastian Clayton</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Partner</td><td>Naomi Campbell (1994), Susie Smith (2006)</td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/Clayts15</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.40909090909091><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/u2/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0165651</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28070175438596><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/adam-clayton-mn0000927039</a></td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Awards</td><td>22 Grammy awards: Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Rock Album; 10 Q Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, & BRIT Awards, Orville H.
