Unsurprisingly, her net worth has also skyrocketed. Let’s examine what that net worth is as we look back on her rise to stardom.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>PLAN B OUT FRIDAY presave it NOW <a href=#>https://t.co/9cxzLaWOUu</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Vy7To8R0VQ</a></p>— TINA SNOW (@theestallion) <a href=#>April 20, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>After utilizing social media to gain popularity by showing off her rapping skills, Megan Thee Stallion debuted on the U.S. Billboard Charts in 2019 with “Big Ole Freak” and first entered the Top 10 later that year with “Hot Girl Summer,” a collaboration with Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla Sign.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>The following year, she scored multiple #1 hits with “Savage” (the remix version with Beyoncé) and “WAP” (a collab with fellow rap star Cardi B). Overall, she has 18 singles, collab or solo, in the last four years that have peaked in the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>In 2021, she began reaping the rewards of her previous year. First, in March, she won three Grammys including Best New Artist. Then, in June, she won four BET Awards, more than anyone else in 2021.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Megan Thee Stallion’s cover of Sport Illustrated's 2021 Swimsuit Issue. 🚨 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mKH2RNgq0K</a></p>— MUSICXCLUSIVES (@MusicXclusives) <a href=#>July 19, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>In July, she became the first rapper to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, gracing the cover of the swimsuit edition. A week later, she teamed up with Revlon to introduce her own makeup collection, appropriately called Revlon x Megan Thee Stallion Hot Girl Sunset Collection. It’s fairly ingenious, actually, with each set including lip gloss, eyeshadow, false eyelashes, and more.</p><p data-characters=80 data-current-count=80 data-injectable=false>In November, she was named Glamour Magazine’s “Woman of the Year.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false><p lang=da dir=ltr>Megan <a href=#>@TheeStallion</a> stuns for <a href=#>@GlamourMag</a>.</p><p>📸: Kennedi Carter <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/y9XF7xfm1t</a></p>— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href=#>November 2, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>To top it all off, in December, she teamed up with CashApp to sell her HOT Girl Enterprise clothing collection to benefit numerous charities focused on “education, housing, and health & wellness.”</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Now, as the world impatiently waits for her new single, it’s safe to say that Megan Pete (you didn’t think her last name was “Thee Stallion,” did you?) has greatly increased her net worth over the last couple years.

That has more than doubled in the last several months, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, who estimates her present net worth to be $8 million dollars. This is certainly a testament to Megan’s many achievements and business partnerships in the past year.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>In case you’re wondering, like we were, if this makes her the richest stallion of all time, the answer is not yet.
