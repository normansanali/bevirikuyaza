Well, she’s Sminty Drop — whose first impression never goes well (Ofc, because of her eyebrows).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Get to know her better as this Sminty Drop Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Sminty Drop On RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Season 4</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sminty Drop made quite an impression on the contestants as she stepped onto the stage of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>RuPaul’s Drag Race UK</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 4. Walking the ramp with a helmet on, only to take it off and say, “Let’s ride loser,” it was obvious, she’d be the center of scrutiny.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But Sminty couldn’t care less.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Furthermore, she even went on to describe herself as a “luxe queen” who wants “to be a masterpiece”.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“B**ch,” fellow contestant Baby uttered right after seeing her.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, this wasn’t the first anyone’s ever called her a “b**ch.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“When people first meet me they seem to think I am the most horrible person ever. But they come up and see me and say ‘I was told you were going to be a massive b**ch but I think it’s just your eyebrows,” Sminty shared.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, coming to the tasks, Sminty wore a bejeweled outfit with a lampshade headpiece when asked to create an outfit inspired by the BBC to commemorate its 100th anniversary.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Later, she then wore a Renaissance-inspired outfit to reflect her drag persona. “I’ve got my latex gloves and stockings on because I like that Renaissance look — Huge hair, huge nails, tiny waist,” the drag queen explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And thanks to her “fierce” looks, Sminty moved on to the next round.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On the other hand, a fellow competitor, Just May lost a lip-sync battle to </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Dakota Schiffer</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> (the first trans woman to ever appear on the series) and was eliminated.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, the remaining drag queens alongside Sminty were — Baby, Black Peppa, Cheddar Gorgeous, Copper Top, Danny Beard, Dakota Schiffer, Jonbers Blonde, Le Fil, Pixie Polite, and Starlet.</span></p><h3><b>Sminty Drop Out Of Drag</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sminty Drop looks beautiful as ever, even out of drag.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, without make-up, she lacks those iconic eyebrows and that “b**chy” look. Infact, she had no eyes brows at all as she shaved them to maintain her drag persona without hassle.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her original eye color is blue.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here’s a picture of her out of drag.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sminty-Drop-Out-Of-Drag-283x300.jpg><h3><b>What Is Sminty Drop Real Name?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Drag queen Sminty Drop’s real name is “Callum Shaw”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her drag name “Sminty Drop” came from her habit of taking some mints with her just in case she wanted to kiss some boys on a night out. However, given that she’s also a very clumsy girl, she would always drop the mints on the floor. Thus, she became&nbsp; “Sminty Drop.”</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact: </b><span style=font-weight:400>Sminty doesn’t want anyone to come to her funeral in drag. “I’d want all the attention on me. In fact, if anyone comes to my funeral in drag, I’ll haunt them,” she joked.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Sminty Drop?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The drag queen was born on January 31, 1999. That made her 23 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>RuPaul’s Drag Race UK</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She was the second youngest contestant that season.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The youngest was Dakota (22 then).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As per her birthday, Sminty is of the Aquarius zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Sminty Drop Partner</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2022, Sminty Drop was in a&nbsp; relationship with her partner </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Joe Hinsh</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. They had their first holiday together in Ibiza in May 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to her, she was in a “very stable relationship” with him.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But things weren’t always like this. In the past, Sminty used to be a wild girl who hooked up with people without even knowing their names.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But in her defense, the first time, she had her “beer goggles” on. “I literally thought I was going home with Usher! I had to slip out the back door in the morning,” she said.</span></p><h3><b>Sminty Drop Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sminty Drop is a drag model.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As a drag, she has worked with several artists including </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Ru Paul’s Drag Race</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star Utica for the “Queen Of The Unexpected” UK tour hosted by Klub Kids.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But since just modeling wasn’t enough to pay her bill, she took on several part-time jobs — none of which last more than a year. And even when she quit, the star never gave in a notice or wrote a letter of resignation. “I usually just tell a few of my close work friends I cba working there anymore and will probably end up leaving soon then just never show up to a shift again, lmao,” Sminty added.</span></p><p><b>Fun fact:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Sminty was starstruck by Naomi Campbell walking through a fashion week party once. “I nearly threw up on the floor. I was crying and vomiting and shaking all at once,” she recalled.</span></p><h3><b>Sminty Drop Family</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sminty didn’t reveal her real family.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But we do know her drag grandmother is Rehab Kendoll and her drag mother is Gothy Kendoll from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Ru Paul’s Drag Race</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><b>Trivia: </b><span style=font-weight:400>It was Sminty’s nan who got her into tea —&nbsp; a milky, sugary tea.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Sminty Drop From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sminty hails from Clitheroe, Lancashire, England, UK.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Is Sminty Drop On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of September 2022, Sminty boasted 74.8K followers on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>smintydrop</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s her Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>smintyd</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Tall Is Sminty Drop?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sminty stands tall at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm).</span></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrKWZo8G6ecOrpqllkp68br7EmqNmppGism68wKurp52iYq6osYyorK1ln5t6pb7AoGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
