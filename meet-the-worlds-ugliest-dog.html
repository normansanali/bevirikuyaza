The second runner-up was Frodo, a 12.5-year-old Chinese crested hairless-chihuahua mix from Sparks, Nevada, who loves to be bossy, according to his official bio.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>UNITED STATES, Petaluma : Sweepee Rambo, a Chinese Crested, is… <a href=#>http://t.co/b9Yvyldega</a> <a href=#>#photography</a></p><p>— Luis (@SGuillen_LuiS) <a href=#>June 27, 2015</a></p><p>Because many of the homely hounds, including this year’s ugliest, come from shelters and puppy mills, the contest aims to encourage adoption of dogs regardless of their physical shortcomings.</p><p>Quasi Modo’s owner found him at an animal shelter, according to his biography on the contest’s website.</p><p>“Luckily, one of the veterinarians there saw the sparkle in my eyes and took me home,” his bio says.</p><p>He has multiple birth defects to his spine and his back is too short for the rest of his body.</p><p>“In spite of this I still run, play and enjoy life to the fullest.”</p><p>Grown men have mistaken him for a hyena or Tasmanian devil and jumped on their cars to get away from him, “but once they get to know me I win them over with my bubbly personality,” the bio says.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Quasi Modo crowned the world's ugliest dog: <a href=#>http://t.co/eIrDdUcWIr</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AfUwulv2Dd</a></p><p>— ABC News (@ABC) <a href=#>June 27, 2015</a></p><p>“I love to meet new people and teach them about diversity. I have become a great ambassador for teaching people about acceptance and tolerance for things that are different. You should never judge a book by its cover! Just because an animal or person looks different doesn’t mean they’re any less deserving of love. It’s OK to be different.”</p><p>This was his second year in the contest after making his debut in 2014. His owners brought him to the contest during their honeymoon.</p><p>The Spirit Award was presented to Precious, an 8-year-old chihuahua from Petaluma, for visiting disabled veterans with her owner.</p><p>“My mom is a disabled veteran and gives of her time volunteering also. She says there is no ‘I’ in team, we believe in team spirit and teamwork. She and I love to help others who are down and out no matter what the cause or economic status,” Precious says in her bio.</p><p>Precious has a “sight issue” from the vet putting wrong drops in her eye as a puppy, according to her bio. She loves long walks on the beach at sunset, rides in the car with the wind in her face, picnics, table scraps (even though I get a balanced diet), doggy treats and rides in my stroller.</p><p>“I’m living my life with purpose and love.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is the officially the World’s Ugliest Dog <a href=#>http://t.co/x4ZsNBMVTJ</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/veXxU5ACP9</a></p><p>— Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) <a href=#>June 27, 2015</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is Quasi Modo.
