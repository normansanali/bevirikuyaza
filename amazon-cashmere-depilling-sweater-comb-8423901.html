But, that doesn’t change the fact that the saying holds very true; it's chilly outside, with the first official snowfall of the season hitting NYC this past weekend (yay!), and the smartest staple to wear is, in fact, a cozy, cuddly sweater that'll keep you warm and looking cute all day long. It'll be that way for the next four months — at least.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But that’s good news for me, because I love sweaters. I grew up in Minnesota, and yes, it is actually as cold as you’ve probably heard, but that’s also given me very thick skin, not to mention made me quite the winter expert. Sweaters were always a saving grace, as is layering (of course), but the truth is, you can’t really layer properly without a good knit. So, I would wear my sweaters to death — only to eventually be met with one very annoying thing: <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">sweater pilling</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because I refuse to buy new sweaters every year, simply because they have subtle signs of wear from, well, wearing, I decided to invest in <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a $12 Amazon hack</a> that makes all my most-worn knits look as good as new. I swear. And it’s basically foolproof to use, too, which makes it all the more appealing, given some fabric removers are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>actual shavers</a> and I fear they’ll only further ruin my sweater (they won’t, but the idea simply scares me).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alas, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the Lona Scott Cashmere Comb</a> is a breeze to use — not to mention, it’s kind of, sort of fun and super satisfying, as you see all the lint, pills, and combs being removed with each brush. Love! The best part? It can be used on all types of sweaters; I’ve used it on my cotton Free People knits just as I’ve relied on it for my pricey cashmere, and the result is all the same — sweaters that look as good as they did in store.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We all know that wearing and improper washing can quickly wreak havoc on a knit, no matter the material, but now you can rest assured that those pesky pills and other notable signs of wear can be brushed away, literally, with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this cashmere comb</a>. I’ve already turned my mom on to it, who’s a devoted sweater wearer who’s often complained about pills. Next? My sister — and you, of course.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’m not the only one who’s totally in awe of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this $12 Amazon hack</a>. The comb averages an impressive 4.3-star ratings, with hundreds of reviews that echo my love for it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Whipped the pill from my cashmere sweater <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">in a flash</a>,” said one shopper. “So easy to clean and feels good in the hand.” <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Another agreed</a>:, “I have tried several other brushes and even an electric ‘de-baller,’ which took me hours to use to remove all the little balls. This is so quick and easy.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a reasonable $12, your sweaters will look as good as new — and yes, that’s the smartest thing you can buy today. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shop the game-changing tool</a> before it sells out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wKaYs6eeYrCiv8emnKudXZmysbXLpaCnn12oxKat056pZpufoq9uhJNranJoYQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
