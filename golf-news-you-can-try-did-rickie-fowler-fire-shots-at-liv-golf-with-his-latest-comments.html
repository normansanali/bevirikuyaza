Moreover, he does not shy from expressing his opinions. And the 5-time PGA Tournament winner is also good at taking subtle digs at rival factions.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Rickie Fowler takes an indirect dig at LIV</strong></h2><p><span>In a <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>press meet</a> during the WM Phoenix Open, the 34- year-old was asked if he would like if all the PGA Tour events had the same energy as the 16th hole at TPC Scottsdale.</span></p><p><span>Fowler feels what happens at WM Phoenix Open is unique. “This place can’t be duplicated,” he said. “You can try, but the amount of time and effort that’s gone into this over decades to get it to where it is now.“</span></p><p><span>Additionally, he also took a jab at LIV Golf by expressing that other places try to recreate the energy, but he doesn’t feel that anything can match up to it. “Places try and do some stuff to get the energy up and get some stands and crowds around a certain hole or area.“</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Rickie-Fowler-4.jpg><p>LIV Golf promotes its events to be an immersive and enjoyable experience for the fans. The fans are allowed to choose their viewing platforms. Moreover, they have a Fan Village that includes various activities for golf enthusiasts. But, Fowler indirectly stated through his statement that all of this will never be a match to the Phoenix Open.</p><p><span>Rickie is happy with experiencing the sea of fans at the 16th hole just for a week. Moreover, he believes it has taken a lot of time and effort from Thunderbirds and Waste Management to make this event so successful.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Fowler was speculated to join LIV Golf</strong></h2><p><span>Last year Rickie was presented with a great offer to join LIV Golf. But he rejected the offer and expressed that he will stay with the PGA Tour. Moreover, the former world no. 4 believed things were going great for him there.</span></p><p><span>However, he also added that even though everything is fine, it can’t stay the same always. This left room for speculation that he might be considering joining the Saudi-backed golf faction. </span><span>Moreover, with the steep <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>decline in his performance</a> over the years, it seemed okay that he wasn’t making any hasty decisions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Watch this story:&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>‘I Would Have Taken a Bullet for This Guy’: Greg Norman’s Strong Betrayal With Chris Evert Forced His Best Friend to Denounce Their Relationship Once</a></strong></p><p><span>Even though he denied joining the LIV Golf rumors, fans didn’t completely believe him since many did the same only to join the league later. However, after his indirect dig at the Invitational Series, it became clear that he has no intention to play for the PGA Tour rivals.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8aoo59lnprEtHnYqKxmm5GjerW%2B2Gabopxdp7akt8ieZJ%2Bnp6Gys3nFoqmeZaOdvLW%2FjJqrZqSZq3qou8ufZLChpJ16qbXSZqOarJWowW6vzqaknqakqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
