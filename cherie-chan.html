That is on its way. It can be a little tricky with COVID. But I’m hoping that as COVID settles down with the vaccine, this year will be the perfect opportunity for me to follow through on what I’ve had in mind-the perfect proposal for Cherie.”&nbsp;</p><p>He expresses a desire to “do something special”. So, while it’s possible that these two married secretly and are saving the details for season two of Bling Empire, it seems unlikely given how much they share online.</p><h2><span id=Cherie_Chan_8211_Body_Measurements>Cherie Chan – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Cherie Chan is a stunning actress and model with a <strong>height</strong> of 5 ft 3 in or 1.60 m or 160 cm.
