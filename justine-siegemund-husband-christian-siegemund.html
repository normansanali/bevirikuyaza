Some scholars believe that she was of Jewish descent, while others argue that she was of German or Slavic origin.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there is no conclusive evidence to support either of the claims.</p><p>According to one hypothesis, Justine Siegemund was Jewish by birth because her mother was Jewish.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Justine-Siegemundin-FrauenOrte-Brandenburg.png><p>This argument is based on the fact that midwifery was a common occupation for Jewish women in 17th-century Germany, where many Jews worked as healers and midwives.</p><p>Since Justine’s religious background is unknown, it’s possible that she converted to Christianity at a later time in her life.</p><p>According to a different theory, Justine Siegemund was of German or Slavic descent.</p><p>This notion is supported by the fact that her husband’s and her own names are common German names.</p><p>This idea does not, however, explain why Justine was so proficient in midwifery, which at the time was not a prevalent occupation for German or Slavic women.</p><p>Read more: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Bruce Lehrmann Wikipedia – Who Is He?
