His character and Olga (Magdalena Lamparska) later develop feelings for each other and ….. let’s not spoil the rest.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, we do like to mention Domenico wasn’t treated very kindly by Massimo (Michele Morrone). And we’re not the only one who feels this way. “I’m not calling Domenico a bitch but why tf you letting Massimo snatch you up like a pit bull puppy,” a fan tweeted.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But be that as it may, Domenico undoubtedly has garnered a lot of fans. “F*ck massimo from 365 days. I want domenico LIKE HE’S A FINE ASS MAN,” another tweet read.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>All excited for the movie’s premiere, Otar took it to his IG on April 27 to write, “ Let me send special greetings for all Ukrainian fans out there. While celebrating the premiere we did not forget especially about you. Stay strong Ukraine 365 days “This day”, is out on @netflix.”</span></p><h3><b>Is Otar Saralidze Gay?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Otar Saralidze isn’t gay.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, his co-stars from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>365 Days: This Day</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Michele Morrone, and Simone Susinna aren’t gay either. Though Michele shared an evocative pool selfie with&nbsp; Simone in his arms, he later took to his Stories again to clarify that he isn’t gay!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As per the actor, Simone and he became very good friends, and they took the selfie as brothers. “Guys, it was just a picture.
