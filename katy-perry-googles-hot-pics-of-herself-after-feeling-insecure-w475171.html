On Saturday, April 1, the “Teenage Dream” singer shared a pic of her younger self in a gray sports bra and with short, messy hair, sitting at an ancient-looking Mac computer. “I’m proud to announce the cover for my 4th album!” she wrote. She later edited the caption to say, “Happy April Fools! Been plotting in the same type of sports bra from my IM and laminated calendar since 99.”</p><p>The second photo was even funnier. The Grammy nominee shared several screenshots of her FaceTime call with an executive at her record label while Perry was mid-facial massage. In the Instagram slideshow from April 5, Perry looks makeup-free as a pair of hands rub her jawline and chin. “WHEN UR ROLLING CALLS WITH UR A&R BUT TRYING TO MASSAGE THE STRESS OUT YA JAW AT THE SAME TIME CAUSE EVERYTHING IS COMING TO A HEAD,” she wrote.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>After her provocative post in her bra, commenters immediately reminded the singer-songwriter, <a href=#>who recently split from <b>Orlando Bloom</b> after a year of dating</a>, just how gorgeous she is. “Wow! Beautiful and powerful!” one person wrote, while another added, “I love your ‘real’ face posts, shows people how much makeup and hair does for a person.” They were also concerned that Perry needed to charge her phone, with the battery at a mere 13 percent.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSuerGx0auwZp%2BfpLStsdJmn6isXaW2pL%2BMqJ1moJWnwKa4xWaYn6yVp3qnscSloKefXZ67tLHCrqmeZadphHZ9lmpm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
