Their power is derived from the emotional electromagnetic spectrum of fear; the corps is led by the supervillain Sinestro.<h2>Why does Sinestro hate Hal Jordan?</h2>And it was capable of breaking through any form generated by a Green Lantern ring.

If you are a lover who knows full well what love is, the Star Sapphires would make a good choice.</p><h2>What can Blue Lanterns do?</h2>Blue Lanterns can heal wounds and regenerate lost body parts. The ring's power can be supplemented with the hope of other living beings; for instance, Saint Walker and Warth were able to reduce a dying sun's age by 8.6 billion years because of the hope emanating from the inhabitants of a nearby planet.<h2>Who is Batman's greatest enemy?</h2>The ultimate Batman villain is a deranged psychopath who acts as more of an agent of chaos than an organised criminal. Also known as the Clown Prince of Crime, the Joker is the arch-enemy of the Dark Knight — one capable of such unthinkable evil that can make even Batman shudder.<h2>Why does the Cheetah hate Wonder Woman?</h2>End of dialog window. The original Cheetah appeared in Wonder Woman #6 in 1943, making her one of Diana's earliest foes. Vain and spoiled debutante Priscilla Rich had no super powers to speak of, and was intensely jealousy of Wonder Woman.<h2>Why did Cheetah become a villain?</h2>In the possession of a dagger once belonging to a lost tribe of Amazons, she accidentally cut herself on it.
