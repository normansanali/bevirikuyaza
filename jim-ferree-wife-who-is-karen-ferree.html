Ferree played college golf at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Following service in the U.S. Army, he turned professional in late 1955.</p><p>Ferree had one PGA Tour win during his regular career years. He was regarded as one of the very best in the game in the tee-to-green ball-striking phase of the game, but putting was always his weakness. He spent most of his thirties and forties as the director of golf at Long Cove Club in Hilton Head, South Carolina.</p><p>Ferree was later a club pro and joined the Senior PGA Tour at age fifty in 1981. He was chosen by PGA Commissioner Deane Beman to be the model for the knickers-wearing player on the Senior Tour’s logo. He shares the Georgia-Pacific Grand Champions record for most victories (9) with two other golfers. He was the Senior PGA Tour’s Comeback Player of the Year in 1993.</p><p>In 1991, he became the first golfer inducted into the University of North Carolina’s Hall of Fame. He lived in Hilton Head, South Carolina with his wife, Karen, also a former champion golfer.</p><p>Ferree died on March 14, 2023.</p><h2>Jim Ferree’s wife: Who is Karen Ferree?</h2><p>He lived in Hilton Head, South Carolina with his wife, Karen, also a former champion golfer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKZonqnsdGrnJ5lp56zpnnWoaZmoaNiuKK%2BxKdkn52ip7Kmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
