Because of that fear, it can be a lot easier to choose silence, but today I’m choosing to speak.”</p><p>The Georgia native, who shares Willa, 4, Ada, 2, and <a href=#>Lennon</a>, 3 months, with <a href=#>his wife,<strong> Lauren Akins</strong></a>, went on to write that he felt “heartbroken and angry” after watching the video of a police office killing Floyd pressing a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes.</p><p>“I get scared when I think about my daughters and what kind of world they will be growing up in and how <a href=#>my JOB as a father is to show them how to lead with love in the face of hate</a>,” the Grammy nominee added. “To know their worth and value as not only women but human beings.”</p><p>Rhett and Akins, also 30, <a href=#>adopted Willa from Uganda in May 2017</a>, three months ahead of <a href=#>Ada’s birth</a>.</p><p>“<a href=#>My heart has always been driven to [adoption</a>],” the Live in Love author told Us Weekly exclusively the following year. “It just started as this calling in my life, to speak for these children who don’t have a voice. This is what I was really here to do. It lined up perfectly with my heart.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Heigl, 41, who <a href=#>adopted her now-8-year-old daughter, Adalaide, in 2012</a> with her husband,<a href=#><strong> Josh Kelley</strong></a>, shared that she has been <a href=#>struggling to tell her daughter about Floyd’s death</a>.</p><p>“I can’t sleep,” the actress wrote via Instagram on May 31. “And when I do, I wake with a single thought in my head. How will I tell Adalaide? How will I explain the unexplainable? How can I protect her? How can I break a piece of her beautiful divine spirit to do so? I can’t sleep.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see how more celebrity parents are having open dialogues with their children about racism.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJtkqZmimru1v4yem66bkamybrfInapmmZKkwrV50ZqaoqudYq6nwMSrZKCdn6e0pnnFpaaynKNisaat06FmnJmdmr%2BwuoymmK2gmai8r3nAp5tmrpGjsrS%2FwGaYq52mlrmwew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
