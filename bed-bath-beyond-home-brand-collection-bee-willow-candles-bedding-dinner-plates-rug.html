We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. <a href=# rel>Learn more!</a></p><p>Bed Bath & Beyond is our go-to for all of our home and design needs, and while it carries all of the essentials, sometimes we also happen to find items we can’t believe aren’t in a high-end boutique instead.</p><p>Recently, the store launched its first-ever house brand and furniture line called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bee & Willow</a>. The name is chic, and so are the modern, easy-to-incorporate pieces. Even interior designers would have heart eyes over this line. We picked out five pieces we think everyone should check out below, but we’re not going to lie, we’re falling in love with everything, and fast!</p><p><strong>Bee & Willow Home Spiced Vanilla & Cream Candle Collection</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BW-Candles.jpg><p>With this candle collection, we’re bringing the intoxicating and relaxing scent of our favorite local coffee shop into our own home. This collection lets us pick and choose among five Spiced Vanilla & Cream candles, all with a warm, comforting scent we would swear was coming from a chai latte in a mug if it wasn’t coming from burning wax in a cottage-style tin or jar. If we’re looking for the longest burn time possible, check out the 14 oz jar candle, which can burn for up to 80 hours!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bee & Willow Home Spiced Vanilla & Cream Candles</a> starting at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6</a> at Bed Bath & Beyond!</strong></p><p><strong>Bee & Willow Home Shag Throw Blanket in Grey</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bw-Blanket.jpg><p>This knit fabric blanket is no tiny throw. With multiple different textures, it’s like many blankets combined in one! This grey and white blanket is bound fit seamlessly into any home. It features varying sizes of stripes and has fringe details at the ends, which also vary depending on which side of the blanket we’re looking at. We can either keep this as an extra source of warmth on our bed, or drape it over our couch to accent our living room. It would also help to construct the most fashionable blanket fort ever!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bee & Willow Home Shag Throw Blanket in Grey</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$24</a> when you become a BEYOND+ member!</strong></p><p><strong>Bee & Willow Home Striped Apron in Blue/White</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BW-Apron.jpg><p>It’s tiring cooking in the kitchen all the time. So why not try to enhance the experience a little? By wearing this adorable striped apron, we’re actually going to look forward to making that lasagna we’ve been talking about for weeks. And hey, keeping those sauce splash stains off our outfit certainly doesn’t hurt either. We’re super obsessed with the ruffles at the sides of the top along with the contrast pockets. Is it cool if we wear this apron out of the house, too?</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bee & Willow Home Striped Apron in Blue/White</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$12</a> when you become a BEYOND+ member!</strong></p><p><strong>Bee & Willow Home Mayfair Area Rug in Oyster/Biscuit</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BW-Rug.jpg><p>A rug is an excellent way to warm up a room, and it’s often the finishing touch we’ve been looking for. This one, specifically, will match basically any design scheme with its subtle grey, blue, taupe and ivory hues. It has a medallion pattern which mixes modern and vintage together for a timeless design. Let it peek out from under a bed or leave it on full display in the middle of a living room. It’s durable, so don’t worry much about actually stepping on it! That’s what rugs are for. This one comes in a 7-foot runner, as well as two bigger sizes, one five by seven feet and one 7 feet and 10 inches by 9 feet and 10 inches!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bee & Willow Home Mayfair Area Rug in Oyster/Biscuit</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$60</a> at Bed Bath & Beyond!</strong></p><p><strong>Bee & Willow Home Milbrook Dinnerware Collection in Blue</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BW-Milford.jpg><p>With this collection, we’re saying bye to eating out more often than we know we should. It’s so charming, we’ll actually want to eat at home just so we can use these pieces! There are 15 items we can choose from in the Milbrook collection, most of which have a deep ocean-blue color. Many have a speckled bubble-texture accent, too! We can choose from serving plates and bowls, a mug, canisters, a tray, a bread basket, a caddy and glasses. With this set, people are actually going to be fighting over who can set the table for dinner!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bee & Willow Home Milbrook Dinnerware pieces</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3</a> at Bed Bath & Beyond!</strong></p><p><strong>Looking for something else?
