Going back to what I was saying about myself and my younger days, in my younger business ventures, I think business is business. I think Hov said, ‘What’s 100 percent of 0?’ Right, so to me, you ain’t thinking logical when you think you get everything and nobody get nothing from you. That’s not common sense, bro.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Say it’s a brand new artist who walk out this building today. What’s your value today? How much you getting for a show today? How many records you selling today, how much merch you selling today? Nothing. You grossing 500 a year – dollars. So now let’s say us three put the money in, put the work in, now you making $500million a year or $5million, whatever. We not supposed to get none of that?</p><p>“Because it’s a term, they say ‘360’ and it don’t sound cool and you seem like you’re bossed up because you ain’t in one? It’s bullshit. That ain’t business. You basically telling me you want me to put up my money, you want me to put up my time, you want me to take my risk – but you don’t want me to get nothing. Because it ain’t even guaranteed that you’re gonna win.”</p><p>You can view the full interview below:</p><p></p><p>GloRilla seems to have no qualms with Yo Gotti’s deals, as she <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>recently referred to her label head as “da BEST CEO ONA PLANET.”</a></p><p>The declaration arrived upon Glo receiving a birthday gift from Gotti in July – a new Maybach. “Stop playing,” the <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>2023 HipHopDX Rising Star</a> said in disbelief. “What, I’m Maybach shawty now.
