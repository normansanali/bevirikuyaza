You’ve got to put in the time.’”</p><p>The Illinois native, who also shares Lola, 17, and Fiona, 13, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Peter Facinelli</strong></a>, admitted that watching Luca Bella step into acting has been “fun and scary at the same time.” Garth explains, “She’s so young and beautiful. I sit there and think, ‘Oh, my gosh. That was me however many years ago.’ But it’s interesting to watch it from a different perspective now and I’m glad that I’m there to guide her and advise her when she wants or needs it. I didn’t really have that other than my team, my manager or agent, at the time, but to have your mom have experienced similar things is pretty cool.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jennie-Garth-Shares-Acting-Advice-Daughter-Luca-Bella-02.jpg><p>The mother-daughter pair even costarred in Lifetime’s Your Family or Your Life, which premiered in November.</p><p>Acting isn’t the only thing that the two have in common. In fact, Garth and all of her daughters are “weirdly healthy eaters.“ She described their “grazing” snacking habits to Us on Tuesday, saying, “We’ll just come home and hang out in the kitchen and just eat hummus or whatever’s there. And that’s dinner sometimes, because we’re like, ‘Oh, I’m stuffed. I couldn’t eat dinner now.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jennie-Garth-Shares-Acting-Advice-Daughter-Luca-Bella-01.jpg><p>When it comes to stocking up her kitchen, the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum loves shopping at Sur La Table with the help of Shipt.com. “I just love going in there and looking at all the great products, but … you just download the Shipt app and you pick which store you want to shop at, pick your goods, and then in an hour, someone brings it do your door. You have a personal shopper through this app who picks out exactly what you want. If they don’t have what you want, they text you. … It’s very convenient.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqZ5xpqpraBdqLWivsSsZJqbpJ67qHnAna2im5Vis7C%2BjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzecuumpplkpq5ra2O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
