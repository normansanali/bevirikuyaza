He is currently busy with his life in Hollywood but didn’t have the best of starts when it came to his time on the Silver Screen. In fact, his debut film wasn’t even supposed to star him.</p><p>Cena’s debut movie was&nbsp;The Marine, which was released in 2006. Its critical reception was abysmal and fans didn’t like it either. Even&nbsp;<a href=#>John Cena himself needed drink after watching the movie.</a></p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard</a>, Bruce Prichard confirmed that John Cena was not the original character they had in mind for the role but it was Steve Austin instead. Apparently, Austin turned down the role for ‘The Marine,’ so that he could act in ‘The Condemned’ instead.</p><p>“It was [The Marine was actually written for Stone Cold Steve Austin]. Well, yeah, but see, I think the part of the problem was that the Condemned rating was ‘R.’ And so, it alienated a lot of our audience at that point. But to me, Steve was an ‘R-rated guy’ anyway. I don’t know how you could have done the Condemned with the PG-Rating. But I thought Steve would have been great in The Marine, too.</p><p>But I just liked the concept of the Condemned; I liked the movie. I liked everything about it.”&nbsp;</p><p>John Cena’s role as the Peacemaker in ‘The Suicide Squad’ and his ‘Peacemaker’ spinoff series helped him reach a level of superstardom no one could have even dreamed of in the past.</p><p>Regarding Cena’s return to the WWE ring, nothing has been announced thus far but we reported earlier this year<a href=#> that the former champion is always ‘on call’ i</a>n case the company ever needs him. When will that happen? Only time will tell.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed readability=2><p>https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-359-cyber-sunday-2007/id1139391156?i=1000584465593</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Did you like John Cena in The Marine?
