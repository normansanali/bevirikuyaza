However, a picture of his mugshot was made only for advertising his program. Hansen was detained in Connecticut in January 2019 on suspicion of writing a fraudulent check and theft after reportedly failing to reimburse a vendor for $13,000 in marketing supplies.</p><p>Later, he handed himself into the police, and after posting bail, he was let go. Even though Hansen’s arrest at the time made news, he was not given a prison term.</p><p>According to reports, he and the prosecution came to an agreement in September 2019 under which the accusations against him would be withdrawn in exchange for community service and compensation to the vendor. It is unknown whether he fulfilled the community service, but the 2020 dismissal of the charges against him.</p><h2><span id=Accusations_and_Allegations_Against_Chris_Hansen>Accusations and Allegations Against Chris Hansen</span></h2><p>Throughout his career, Chris Hansen has been the target of several claims and charges, both connected to and unrelated to his work on “To Catch a Predator.” He was charged with not paying him for his work on a Kickstarter effort to restart “To Catch a Predator” in 2018 by a former worker.</p><p>The worker said that Hansen made a commitment to pay him a portion of the monies generated but then broke it. Hansen refuted the accusations, claiming that he had paid the worker what was due.</p><p>In January 2019, Hansen was charged with larceny as a consequence of a check that bounced with a supplier of promotional products. Hansen brought himself up to Connecticut police on January 14 for allegedly faking checks for promotional items worth over $13,000, according to the Stamford Police. The charges were later withdrawn.</p><p>The journalist was supposed to show up and give testimony on an undercover operation in October 2020 before a courtroom in Michigan in July 2021. A warrant was issued in July 2021 for Hansen’s arrest after he failed to show up for court. Later, when he brought himself up, he said that he had skipped court due to a misunderstanding that was being resolved.</p><h2><span id=How_Much_Will_Chris_Hansen_Be_Worth_in_2023>How Much Will Chris Hansen Be Worth in 2023?</span></h2><p>Chris Hansen’s estimated net worth is $1.5 million, based on Celebrity Net Worth.
