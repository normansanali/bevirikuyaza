There’s no need to worry though. You won’t be stuck with an ugly character for your entire playthrough. The character creation screen tells you that you can change your appearance later at a genetics lab, but Starfield’s method of plastic surgery is more commercial than scientific. Here’s how to use Enhance to change your character’s appearance in <a href=#>Starfield</a>.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Change Appearance in Starfield</h2><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>You can change your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield</a> character’s appearance by visiting an Enhance clinic and paying 500 credits for an appointment! This opens the character creator menu, where you can alter your character if you are unhappy with your original design. You can freely change skin tones, and facial features, and even your height and musculature. The Enhance locations do more than just change your appearance in Starfield, as you can even change your name and adjust your pronouns again!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Starfield-Enhance-Locations-Change-Your-Appearance-Pronouns.jpg><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>Enhance is located in every major city throughout the Settled Systems, including New Atlantis, Akila City, Neon, and more. They’re really easy to spot because of their brightly lit facades and eye-catching logos, but you can always check a city’s directory for an exact location if you’re having trouble finding it. Some cities are easy to get lost in, after all.</p><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Starfield-Enhance.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Starfield-Enhance-Locations-Change-Your-Appearance-JR-Waugh.jpg></li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>All Starfield Enhance Locations</h2><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>Typically, Enhance stores will be located in the shopping district of their respective cities. They’re usually near the doctor’s office or Reliant Medical clinic, and their clean, white, sterile appearance sticks out amongst Starfield’s gaudier advertisements. Keep reading to learn where to find Enhance clinics in the Settled Systems’ biggest cities.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>New Atlantis</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Starfield-Enhance-New-Atlantis.jpg><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>The New Atlantis Enhance clinic is located in the Commercial District of the city. It’s almost exactly on top of the fast travel point for the Commercial District. You can find it to the right of the plaza where Terrabrew Coffee is.</p><p data-characters=44 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Where to Buy Digipicks in Starfield</a></p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>It’s a small storefront with an open design, so make sure you look closely so you don’t miss it. Look for the giant sign that says “OUTLAND.” That’s a different store entirely, but it’s right next to the Enhance clinic which doesn’t have its sign, strangely enough.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Cydonia</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Starfield-Enhance-Cydonia.jpg><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>The next available Enhance clinic for low-level Starfield players just beginning their <a href=#>interstellar journey</a> is located in the Cydonia settlement on Mars in the Sol system. While Cydonia is just a dusty little mining colony, it is home to its fair share of shops including Enhance.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>To reach it, head into Cydonia and proceed straight past the bar. Once you reach the stairs overlooking the mining operations, turn left and you’ll see Enhance nestled among some other stores. The logo is different for this one since all of the stores have to match Cydonia’s aesthetic, so keep an eye out for a plain white sign above the door to find the entrance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Neon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Starfield-Enhance-Neon.jpg><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>You’ll become intimately familiar with the seedy streets of Neon during your Starfield playthrough, and the grimy Neon Core is home to an Enhance clinic of its very own. This Enhance is located at the entrance of Neon Core, just a short walk away from the elevator that brings you down from the Spaceport.</p><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>How to Get Legendary Weapons and Armor in Starfield</a></p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true>The signage for this Enhance clinic is different than the usual branding to fit in with Neon’s, well, neon aesthetic. It has a massive pink and green sign hanging above the entrance. You should be able to spot it from the Spaceport elevator.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Paradiso</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Starfield-Enhance-Paradiso.jpg><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>While you won’t visit Paradiso until later in your Starfield journey, you’ll be happy to know there’s an easily accessible Enhance clinic on its home planet as well. When you visit the Poriima system and land on Porrima 2, just follow the main path toward the Paradiso resort and you’ll see the Enhance clinic in its own little blue building to the left.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What is the Best Enhance Location in Starfield to Change Your Appearance?</h2><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=false>The best location is Paradiso, hands-down, especially if you want bang for your buck as this location offers the Paradiso Getaway Bundle. I recommend this for your first Enhance trip because it only costs 700 credits, but gives you a second Enhance appointment to change your appearance if you are still unsatisfied with the first one. This is a one-time offer for first-timers to Paradiso, so use it wisely!</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
