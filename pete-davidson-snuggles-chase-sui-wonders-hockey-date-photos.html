The couple had a romantic getaway that seemed to go well and were photographed leaving the Maui airport while on their way back home. They were both dressed comfortably and flashed smiles from ear to ear.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Pete and Chase were first spotted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>out and about together in NYC</a> back in Dec. It seems they struck up a friendship while making Bodies Bodies Bodies and it turned into more after Pete broke up with model <strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong> last month. They haven’t been afraid to show off PDA, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>like kissing</a>, during some of the moments they’ve been seen together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Before Pete dated Chase and Emily, he made headlines for his long-term relationship with <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>. He was also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>previously romantically involved</a> with other beauties like <strong>Ariana Grande</strong>, <strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong>, and <strong>Margaret Qualley</strong>. When he’s not getting attention for his love life, he’s doing so for his appearance. In addition to his romance with Chase, Pete recently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made headlines</a> for showing off a newly shaved head at a basketball game on Jan. 31.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze5BqZqmdpJp6pa3Vopusp55iwK%2FBxqCjnqtdmLWiv8Rmqq6hXay8r7DEq6pmoJ%2BYuKbFjJ2YrZ1dpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
