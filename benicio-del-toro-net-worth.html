He has portrayed the historical figure of Che Guevera, numerous criminal characters, Star Wars heroes, figures from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and many more.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Benicio Monserrate Rafael del Toro Sánchez was born on February 19th of 1967 in San Germán, Puerto Rico. Raised in a Roman Catholic household alongside an older brother by two lawyers, Benicio was raised primarily in the barrio of Santurce in San Juan. During his childhood, he earned the nicknames "Beno" and "Skinny Benny." After attending Catholic schools in Puerto Rico, Benicio and his family relocated to Mercersburg, Pennsylvania – six years after his mother had passed away from hepatitis.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Benicio attended the University of California, where he first studied drama as an elective. Del Toro quickly proved that he had natural talents as an actor, and this prompted him to drop out of college and study under renowned acting teachers like Stella Adler and Arthur Mendoza. During this period, Benicio also became involved with the Circle in the Square Theatre School in New York City.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Throughout the 80s, del Toro was mostly typecast as criminals and drug dealers in small TV roles. Some of his earliest appearances were on shows like "Miami Vice" and "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story." He gained slightly more notoriety towards the end of the 80s, and his film debut came in 1988 with "Big Top Pee-wee." Next year, he became the youngest-ever actor to play a Bond villain in "License to Kill," at 21 years of age.</p><p>In the 90s, Benicio del Toro began to establish himself as a film actor, taking roles in movies such as "The Indian Runner," "China Moon," "Christopher Columbus: The Discovery," "Money For Nothing," "Fearless," and "Swimming with Sharks." Although these roles helped advance Benicio's career, they paled in comparison to his next booking. In 1995, he gave a breakout performance in "The Usual Suspects," playing a mumbling, incoherent criminal called Fred Fenster.</p><p>Critics were quick to heap praise upon del Toro for this role, and he won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male.

This surrealist performance paved the way for a growing fanbase for the actor. In 2000, he starred in "The Way of the Gun." However, that year was dominated by his performance in "Traffic," in which he played a Mexican policeman who was struggling to uphold justice amidst widespread corruption. He spoke most of his lines in Spanish and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Benicio was also honored with a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild award for this performance.
