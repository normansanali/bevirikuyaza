While sitting across from <a href=#><strong>Conan O'Brien</strong></a>'s coiffed red hair,<strong> Jon Cryer</strong> made a confession about his own follicular situation during an appearance on <a href=#>Conan</a> Monday, Nov. 11.</p><p>While reminiscing about his "spectacular mane of unruly wonderfulness" in the 1986 romantic comedy Pretty in Pink (he starred opposite <strong>Molly Ringwald</strong>), the 48-year-old actor revealed that his hair is "gone now."</p><p>"This is an elaborate illusion," the Two and a Half Men star said pointing to the top of his head. "This is the work of several talented professionals making the most of like four hairs. It's amazing, actually, what they can do. I'm not wearing a piece — or anything like that — but it's a long involved process that starts with stuff like shoe polish, basically, that they coat the top."</p><p>"They basically just paint — they get a roller type thing — and just whoosh along the top," Cryer described while demonstrating painting his head. "You have to decide if you're going to go full <a href=#>[<strong>John</strong>] <strong>Travolta</strong></a> and get the full front in," he joked of the 59-year-old actor's famous widow's peak. "And then they literally sprinkle powder in from a salt shaker. So this is, like I said, four or five hairs."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>What happens if he gets caught in the rain?</p><p>"You're out of luck," Cryer said with a laugh. "It flattens out and you can get the nice little rivulets going down. But thankfully, your eyebrows will channel down the side."</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: How do you think Cryer's painted-on hair looks?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2B8r3nCq7CeqqNitaK10WagrGWWlrimedGoo6WrXaS7brzAoqWtZZakv26xy5qZqKqRqbJutculrKyhn6N6c3yQbGhraWFk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
