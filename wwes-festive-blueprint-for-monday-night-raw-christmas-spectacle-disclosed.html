This decision has prompted the company to make adjustments to its touring schedule leading up to Christmas. Monday Night RAW will be taking place on Christmas this year and WWE already has plans for the show.</p><p>To bridge the gap before the festive tour kicks off, WWE has scheduled live episodes of Raw on December 11 and December 18. The upcoming Raw on the 11th already has a lot of hype behind it as the show is set to feature the return of CM Punk and a clash between Cody Rhodes and Shinsuke Nakamura.</p><p>WWE has also planned a live episode of SmackDown in Green Bay on December 15, followed by the taping of the December 22 episode. As the holiday spirit takes center stage, there is speculation surrounding the content of the Christmas night episode of Raw. Last year, WWE treated its audience to a best-of show on Christmas night, and fans are curious whether this year will be the same thing again.</p><p>According to Dave Meltzer on the&nbsp;<a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, it was noted that they were told by one WWE executive that the event is likely to be a best-of show yet again.</p><p>“It appears the 12/25 Raw will be a best-of show since there is no show being taped, but WWE hasn’t publicly confirmed it, but one executive there said that to the best of his knowledge, it was accurate.”</p><p>As the holiday season unfolds, WWE fans are already getting into the holiday spirit, so a best-of edition of Monday Night RAW will be a nice way to wind back and simply look back on the incredible 2023 the company had. We’ll have to see how the year will end for WWE.</p><p>What’s your view on this story? Do you feel WWE should have done something else for the Christmas episode of Monday Night RAW?
