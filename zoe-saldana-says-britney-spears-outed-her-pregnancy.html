We weren’t trying to hide it, we were just trying to be discreet.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A few days later, Spears was asked during an interview with Entertainment Tonight if she and Saldana might work together again someday and the baby news came out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Who knows? That’s a very good idea. But she’s pregnant with twins right now.

I love her — I don’t mean that in a negative way, I mean that in the way that she lives her life in such truth. I was shocked because we weren’t ready to sort of share that.
