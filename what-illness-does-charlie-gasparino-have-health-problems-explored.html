Health Problems Explored</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Charlie Gasparino was diagnosed with prostate cancer. However, He declared that he would live until he was 120 years old at the very least.</strong></p><p>He revealed the diagnosis on March 26, 2022. He caught Covid a few weeks before his diagnosis, like many New Yorkers, but only experienced moderate symptoms.</p><p>He claimed he worked out every day in my basement, lifting weights and shadow boxing. I ran six miles the day after my ­ten-day quarantine ended.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=charlie-gasparino-illness-sick-health-problems-explored></span>Charlie Gasparino Illness-Sick & Health Problems Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>PSA levels were rising, according to the blood test results. His recent MRI came back OK, but the blood tests continued coming back abnormal, so my doctors suggested a biopsy. The results came back a day later with the news no one wants to hear: Malignant prostate cancer.</p><p>On Monday, the Fox Business anchor came on Neil Cavuto’s FBN show Coast to Coast to share his cancer diagnosis with a man who knows all about it. Cavuto was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1997 and successfully battled “near-death” cancer several years ago.</p><p>Gasparino revealed that he had surgery last week and that he will be recovering soon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=charlie-gasparino-career-a-journalist></span>Charlie Gasparino Career-A journalist<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charlie Gasparino previously worked as a senior writer for Newsweek, where he covered politics, Wall Street, and corporate America, breaking stories such as former New York Stock Exchange chairman Richard Grasso’s controversial pay package and the dispute surrounding former New York Attorney General Eliot Spit.</p><p>Gasparino was a reporter for The Wall Street Journal before joining Newsweek. Despite his brashness, his news has a significant impact on the markets.</p><p>He wrote extensively about Wall Street issues, particularly pension funds, mutual funds, and regulatory issues, during his stint at the WSJ. For his coverage of Wall Street research scandals, he received the New York Press Club award.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-disease-does-charlie-gasparino-have></span>What Disease Does Charlie Gasparino Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charlie Gasparino is suffering from prostate cancer at the age of 60. When detected and treated early, however, it is highly curable.</p><p>Prostate cancer is thought to be hormonal, and it is a silent killer that kills men. It affects about one in every six men and is the second leading cause of cancer death among men. Because it often appears with no symptoms, it is often discovered after it has progressed beyond the gland.</p><p>However, he is unlikely to succumb to prostate cancer. I heeded the advice of my doctors and my wife, who advised me to keep track of my blood work. Dr. James Gasparino, my brother, is a fantastic critical care doctor, but his knowledge extends beyond the ICU, which aided me in my recovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutculpZ6ro2KxsLHSZpqhmaKhtqZ5xpqqqZminruwecearZ5lmJqurcDHZqerp5Khsq6%2FjJ6vqaSfp7Klew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
