And no. He is not likely to quit anytime soon.</p><p>In all those years, the world has seen Kris being pretty great as a miner, despite him being constantly thwarted by his own family.</p><p>Yet, over the years viewers have also witnessed Kelly’s different schemes tumbling to varying degrees. And at these times, the camera has candidly caught him unable to hide his emotions. He has often been seen amid his meltdowns.</p><p>Be that as it may, these losses have not stopped him from longing to prove his legitimacy as a miner. Despite being knocked back again and again, it’s his eternal optimism and big dreams that have actually kept the family moving forward as miners.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kris Kelly’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Kris Kelly, as the captain and co-owner of The Reaper, reportedly had a net worth valued at $200,000 as of early 2023.</p><p>In addition to his yields from ice mining,&nbsp;Kris also gets paid by Discovery for his participation in&nbsp;Bering Sea Gold.

Despite his family’s drama unfolding on the show, this one aspect of his life has remained an exception.</p><p>He seems to have put much effort to ensure that his life with his partner precisely stays undocumented.

It’s a daughter and she turned one before April 2022. “One last break before ice mining”, Kris himself was seen spending some time with the adorable young one back in January 2022.</p><p>And now that there is a baby, there is also a baby mama.

Then, they got to know his two sons, Andrew, aka Andy, and Kris, and their mom (Brad’s wife) Wendy.</p><p>Fans also witnessed Wendy and Brad’s feud which is believed to have lasted well over 30 years. Then, there entered the baby mama, Courtney.
