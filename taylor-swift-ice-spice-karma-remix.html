On May 26, she dropped a remix for her latest single, “Karma,” with a feature from Ice Spice. The song, which is already super popular amongst fans, is elevated to a whole new level with this epic collaboration! In her verse, Ice Spice raps in part, “Now you’re switching up your behavior/ It’s OK baby / you ain’t gotta worry / karma never gets lazy.” Just a day later, Taylor dropped a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>whimsical music video</a> also including Ice Spice, née<strong> Isis Naija Gaston</strong>.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Both women appear to be god like characters in the music video, which borrows heavily from ancient Greek imagery as they represent “karma” itself. Taylor dons several dramatic, costume like looks throughout — including one in which she channels King Midas as an all gold statue in a dress. At other points, she sings inside both an hourglass — representing time — as a well as light bulb. Perhaps her most stylish moment comes towards the end in which she and new pal Ice Spice twin in crystal catsuits (Taylor’s by Kuwait-based designer <strong>Yousef Al Jasmi</strong>) as they hold onto glowing ropes attached to respective planets. Taylor then rows a canoe as Ice Spice sits in front of her before they disappear into the earth — Taylor as mountains and Ice Spice as a cloud, showing that karma is, indeed, all around us.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Taylor announced news of this epic remix on May 24 via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “I’m a massive fan of this brilliant artist and after getting to know her I can confirm: she is THE ONE to watch,” Taylor wrote. “So delighted to say that “Karma” featuring the incredible Ice Spice will be out TOMORROW night at MIDNIGHT ET as part of the new&nbsp;Midnights (Til Dawn Edition) deluxe album.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Karma” was originally released as part of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taylor’s album&nbsp;Midnights</a> in October 2022. Along with this new “Karma” remix, she also dropped a deluxe version of the album, which she called the Til Dawn edition. This included all 13 original songs, as well as the seven previously released&nbsp;3 A.M.&nbsp;tracks. Additionally, it has the “Karma” remix, a new version of “Snow on the Beach” with more&nbsp;<strong>Lana del Rey</strong> vocals, and — finally — the bonus song “Hits Different.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Taylor-Swift-Ice-Spice-Karma-Remix-EC-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Hits Different” was originally released on Target’s version of&nbsp;Midnights as a special bonus track. Fans have been waiting for months to have the song available on streaming services, and now it’s here. On May 26, those who attend Taylor’s concert at MetLife Stadium can also buy a special edition version of&nbsp;Midnights which includes a never-before-heard vault song called “You’re Losing Me.” It’s unclear when or if this song will ever be released to streaming platforms</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Taylor is currently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in the midst</a> of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Eras Tour</a> following her breakup from&nbsp;<strong>Joe Alwyn</strong> earlier this year. She’s recently been linked to singer&nbsp;<strong>Matty Healy</strong>, who has been spotted at multiple Eras Tour shows, as well as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>out with Taylor</a> in New York City and Nashville.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e5FvZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2esKZ50qmgnJ1doK6zucBmqZ6lma18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
