Masterson began working as a child model at the age of four, and by the time he was five, he had appeared in both magazine articles and television ads.</p><p>Masterson started performing at the age of eight and appeared in musicals. By the time he reached adolescence, his singing voice had “disappeared”. He had been in over 100 advertisements by the time he was 16, including those for Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, Hardee’s, Hostess, Tang, and Clearasil.</p><p>Early in the 1990s, Masterson appeared in Beethoven’s 2nd and played the lead role of Justin in Cybill. Masterson decided he wanted to move on after appearing in Cybill’s third and fourth seasons, so he went in for an audition for a program that was first called Teenage Wasteland but eventually renamed to That ’70s Show.</p><p>Debby Romano, the original casting director for That ’70s Show, initially opposed Masterson’s audition since he was a little older than the other actors in the cast, but she eventually gave in.</p><p>She claimed that “he came in and he was just so funny” and that he changed the direction that the part was taking by making Steven Hyde a “tough, funny guy.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Masterson was the only remaining main or supporting cast member of That ’70s Show not asked back to the sequel series That ’90s Show due to the accusations and the ensuing trial, and his character of Steven Hyde was merely not referenced in the new series. Laura Prepon, his former co-star on That ’70s Show and a fellow Scientologist had already left the Church by the time of Masterson’s accusations.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-danny-masterson-religion><strong>Danny Masterson religion</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Danny Masterson is a Scientologist.
