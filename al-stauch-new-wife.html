Her defence team claims that she was not in her right mind when the killing took place, and she has entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.</p><p>Since then, a lot of unsettling information regarding the case has come to light.</p><p>A former KKTV reporter said that Letecia Stauch acted suspiciously during an interview concerning Gannon’s disappearance, and additional testimony indicated that she attempted to pay off a neighbour to lie to police.</p><p>A police arrest document that described the alleged incidents leading up to Gannon’s death was also made public.</p><p>While the prosecution and defence attorneys present their cases in court, the trial continues. What will transpire in Letecia Stauch’s case and how it will be settled in the end are still uncertain.</p><h3>Who did Letecia Stauch try to bribe?</h3><p>This is only one of many recent cases involving bribery and other unlawful behaviour.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/letecia-staunch-murder-trial.jpg alt="al stauch new wife,name change in alabama after divorce,how old is courtney lawes,why did lindsie and will get divorced,why did chriselle get divorce,did les dawson&amp;#039;s wife remarry,sam gannon wife" width=900 height=509 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>For instance, police recently accused FTX founder Bankman-Fried of paying a $40 million bribe, and they jailed college admissions scandal mastermind Rick Singer for 3.5 years for bribing coaches at multiple colleges.</p><p>The outcome of Letecia Stauch’s trial and the impact of her attempted bribery on her punishment are both uncertain. If the court finds her guilty of the crime, the judge will weigh a number of circumstances, including any efforts at bribery, before deciding the appropriate penalty.</p><h3>Where is Al Astauch now?</h3><p>Al Stauch is currently in El Paso County, Colorado, testifying in his ex-wife Letecia Stauch’s murder case.</p><p>Letecia is charged with the murder of her stepson Gannon Stauch in January 2020 by the authorities. Since Gannon’s disappearance, Al has vociferously pushed for justice for him and actively taken part in the hunt for his son.</p><p>To honour Gannon’s memory and inform people of the situation, Al also set up a Facebook page. On April 11th, 2023, he gave a testimony in the trial, and he is still an active participant today.</p><p>Al’s commitment to obtaining justice for his son is admirable and serves as a lesson that, despite the odds, one of us can make a difference if we are ready to stand up for what we believe in.</p><h3>How did Gannon Stauch’s death impact the Colorado Springs community?</h3><p>The killing of Gannon sent shockwaves through the neighbourhood.
