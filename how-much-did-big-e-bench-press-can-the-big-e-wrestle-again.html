Can the Big E wrestle again?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Ettore Ewen is an American professional wrestler and former powerlifter.&nbsp;He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Big E, but is currently inactive due to an injury.</p><p>Ewen was a collegiate football player at the University of Iowa and later became a powerlifter and a USA Powerlifting champion. He also won a state championship in high-school wrestling.</p><p>Upon signing with WWE in 2009, Ewen was assigned to its developmental brand Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) under the ring name Big E Langston. After FCW was rebranded to NXT, he became the second NXT Champion.</p><p>He was promoted to WWE’s main roster in December 2012, and his ring name was shortened to Big E in February 2014.&nbsp; In 2020, Ewen resumed his singles career and was eventually separated from his New Day teammates in the 2020 WWE Draft.</p><p>He won the men’s Money in the Bank ladder match in 2021, before successfully cashing it in later that year to win the WWE Championship, becoming the 33rd Triple Crown Champion in the company’s history.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-did-big-e-bench-press></span>How much did Big E bench press?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>His lifts included a 611-pound squat, a<strong>&nbsp;490-pound bench press</strong>, and a 749-pound deadlift for a 1,850-pound raw total.</p><p>Ewen also won the 2011 USAPL Raw Nationals in Scranton, Pennsylvania. This time, he competed in the super heavyweight division (275+lbs) and broke the raw American and national records in the deadlift (799&nbsp;lbs) and total (2,039&nbsp;lbs).</p><p>All of his national and American raw records have since been broken.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-the-big-e-wrestle-again></span>Can the Big E wrestle again?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Because his vertebrae are not forming bone as quickly as hoped, doctors won’t have a better idea of his status and when or if he can return to the ring until the one-year mark of his recovery in March 2023.</p><p>Still, Big E is grateful since doctors told him a stroke, paralysis or death were possibilities with the injury he suffered, plus he avoided spinal cord and nerve damage.</p><p>For now, Big E is keeping things in perspective and seems happy with the place he is in even though it doesn’t include being able to wrestle right now: “I’m doing really well.</p><p>I can live my life pretty normally. But [my neck is] not in a position where I should be ramming my head against other things, immovable objects. So wrestling doesn’t make sense right now.”</p><p>Big E is playing the waiting game, but given the nature of his injury, it isn’t a certainty he will be able to step back inside the ring.</p><p>If he can’t, the 36-year-old had a spectacular, Hall of Fame-worthy career nonetheless, as a former WWE champion, two-time intercontinental champion and eight-time tag team champion as part of New Day.</p><p>Big E may not be able to compete in the ring right now, but that doesn’t mean he is completely removed from the world of WWE and pro wrestling.</p><p>As reported by Raimondi, Big E will be present for a WWE talent tryout later this month featuring over 50 athletes from other sports, which should be a perfect fit for him, given his successful transition from college football to WWE.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHquwcKhZJ2hlGKvqrOMnmSbnZ6YtW680Z6qrGWTlrtuwMeeZJuhl2KybsPRnqqtpJVirqityKdm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
