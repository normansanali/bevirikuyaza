She thought it was a typical mean girl move by Kim," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told OK! Magazine</a>. “At this rate, these two may never get along. They definitely aren’t ready to forgive and forget yet.”</p><p>It’s unclear what happened between Taylor and Karlie. The once-close friends were photographed doing all sorts of activities together in the past, even doing joint vacations, but that’s seemed to change in recent years, leading to rumors of estrangement.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ttweb_johnny-depp-s-paintings-sold-for-almost-as-much-as-he-d-make-from-his-movie-salaries_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift’s Ex-Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth">Taylor Swift’s Ex-Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>From John Mayer to Joe Alwyn, Taylor Swift has dated quite a few celebrities, and they all have hefty bank accounts.</p><p>“Taylor and Karlie never confirmed or denied they weren’t friends anymore so to see Karlie at her concert was a beautiful gift that everyone was happy to witness,” <a href=#>a source told Life & Style</a>. “The last time they were seen together was in 2018 so clearly something must have happened. … Apparently it wasn’t a major falling out, they were just on a ‘friends break.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-kim-won-rsquo-t-publicly-comment-on-taylor-rsquo-s-diss-tracks>Why Kim Won’t Publicly Comment On Taylor’s Diss Tracks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot-2024-02-26-at-11-39-00-am.png><p>While Kim’s post featuring Karlie may have been a way to take a jab at Taylor, that’s likely the most public reaction she’s going to have, as reports indicate the SKIMS founder has no plans to comment on the situation.</p><p>“Kim probably does have regrets about lying about the editing of the now famous video, but it’s fair to say that she was caught up in the whole Kanye [West] aspect of it,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source claimed to Life & Style</a>.</p><p>“She was basically protecting her man. I’m sure Kim could clear up what really happened, and why she did what she did, but I don’t think she wants to revisit that particular situation,” they went on. “It would just open up a whole new can of worms and she’s truly moved on.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmK9qbvTqGStmamhvLN50rCgn6yjYrK5ecWroJ6mlGK4or7Lopxmo5ykwLR5w6KqrGWgpMC1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
