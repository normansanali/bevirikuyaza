Revisiting previous iterations of a character could become perfectly commonplace, something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. But it’s happening and there could be another big one coming if a certain director has his way. Kevin Smith is lobbying hard for Christian Bale to take part in The Flash, giving fans some Caped Crusader equivalent to what went down in Spider-Man: No Way Home.&nbsp;</p><p>While speaking on his <a href=#>Fatman Beyond</a> podcast (via <a href=#>ComicBook.com</a>), Kevin Smith discussed The Flash and what the movie could mean for the DC Extended Universe when it hits the big screen later next year. During that talk, he brought up the possibility of Christian Bale reprising his role of Bruce Wayne/ Batman in the movie. Smith talked about why the franchise should consider it and what it would mean for DC to wrap all of the versions of Batman into one movie. Check out what he had to say:&nbsp;</p><p>“…this Flash movie they’re setting up with Michael Keaton being Batman, that will bring tears to my eyes. That is my Batman!… If they want to do a No Way Home, though, they better bring in Christian Bale as well, though. If I’m them, I’m backing a money truck up to Christian Bale’s just begging to get him for two minutes so we can have our own No Way Home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/christian-bale-batman-900x506.jpg><p>Kevin Smith doesn’t mention it in this context, but in addition to Michael Keaton reprising his Batman role from the Tim Burton movies in <a href=#>The Flash</a>, Ben Affleck is also set to make an appearance as his version of the character as well. Considering he’s part of the same Justice League timeline as Ezra Miller, this part makes sense. They are part of the same world after all. But adding Christian Bale to the mix would complete the group, getting every living actor who’s suited up for the role into one movie together.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Kevin Smith bringing up the No Way Home in the context of getting Christian Bale on screen with the other guys references what the Marvel Cinematic Universe just pulled off in their latest Spider-Man movie. That’s because we saw current Peter Parker Tom Holland joined by both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield who had played the web-slinger in the past. It was an epic film, culminating multiple story arcs through different parts of the franchise. The story, in this way, spanned decades.&nbsp;</p><p>And while Kevin Smith isn’t the decision-maker when it comes to this kind of casting move, Giant Freakin Robot <a href=#>had the scoop</a> earlier this year that Christian Bale would be making way back into the cape and cowl for The Flash. While details were light at the time about what that could mean, there was speculation that it was going to be in lieu of Michael Keaton if the latter didn’t agree to return. We know Keaton is signed on though meaning the studio could have taken a step back in that process.&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin Smith isn’t wrong to get excited about the prospect of having Christian Bale joining Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck in a little Batman reunion in The Flash. With Ezra Miller speeding his way through the DC equivalent of the Multiverse, why not take a stroll through the Christian Bale timeline as well? We can finally find out if he and Anne Hathaway’s Selena Kyle are living happily ever after.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ibmKe2tMDImqVmmpGhsm7Ax55kn6SRqLVvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
