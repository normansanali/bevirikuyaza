So it’s no surprise that stars take the opportunity to have fun with their red carpet looks, and for some that means <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly naked</a> ensembles.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rose McGowan</strong></a> was the first A-lister to turn heads in a totally sheer dress that left little to the imagination. She walked the 1998 red carpet with her then-boyfriend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Marilyn Manson</strong></a> in a chainmail dress that showcased her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nipples</a> and animal print thong. Almost immediately it became one of the most iconic looks in red carpet history.</p><p>Since then, other stars have followed in her footsteps, showing skin and occasionally underwear. Some literally! For instance, in 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Amber Rose</strong></a> mimicked the Charmed actress in her own chain version of the dress designed by Laurel DeWitt.</p><p>In 1999, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lil Kim</strong></a> presented the Best Hip-Hop Video alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Diana Ross</strong></a> wearing a lavender jumpsuit with one boob covered by nothing more than a pasty. When they took the stage, the icon just couldn’t help but acknowledge it, grabbing the “Crush on You” singer’s breast and jiggling it. Don’t worry, Lil Kim said she was nice about it.</p><p>“A lot of people ask ‘how did you feel?’” Lil Kim said in an interview later. “But honestly, I think she was just giving me a little motherly tap. Like, ‘Girl, do you know you have a boob hanging out?’”</p><p>But not all of the skin-baring looks were controversial. Many celebs donned incredibly classy numbers, such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>, who showed some skin in a Charbel Zoe number with high slits and stylish cutouts. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rita Ora</strong> </a>slayed on the 2019 red carpet in a floor-length Giuseppe Zanotti gown that featured a swirl design with tulle interlay. It was completely see-through but totally stylish.</p><p>From McGowan’s iconic chainmail dress to Ora’s stunningly sexy designer gown, keep scrolling to see the most naked VMA looks of all time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvVppisZZ2kwLV5zZqinpxdobywt9Jmpp9lkaG5bsDIppxmm6KWx7p5xZqqoaGfo3qxtcKsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
