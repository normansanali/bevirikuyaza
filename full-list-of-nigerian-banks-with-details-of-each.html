The Central Bank is referred to as the Bank of Bankers. The CBN controls and monitors the activities of the other banks. It is a regulatory body too for these banks and other financial institutions in Nigeria.</p><p>Thanks to the activities of the CBN, the number of banks has been reduced to about 25 and the few remaining ones are very strong and viable. The CBN ensured those banks that had no solid financial foundation were struck out. This was the factor that led to merging among banks some years ago.</p><p>Banks in Nigeria are of different types. Some of them are commercial banks with license for national operation.&nbsp; There are others too that are approved by the CBN to operate commercial banking license with international authorization.</p><p>Aside from those ones, there are also banks that are given commercial banking license with regional authorization by the CBN. Jaiz bank is the only bank in Nigeria having non-interest banking license with national authorization.
