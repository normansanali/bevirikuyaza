It succeeded the Yuan Dynasty and preceded the Qing Dynasty, marking nearly three centuries of rule.</p><p>Founded by Zhu Yuanzhang — later referred to as the Hongwu Emperor — the dynasty was characterized by its strong central government, economic prosperity, and contributions to art and literature.</p><p>During the Ming era, China saw the construction of some of its most famous architectural achievements, including the majority of what is today the Great Wall of China and the Forbidden City in Beijing.</p><p>The period was also notable for the voyages of Zheng He, a Chinese admiral who led seven expeditions to the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as Africa.</p><p>The later years of the Ming Dynasty, however, saw challenges such as fiscal instability — exacerbated by rampant corruption and inefficient taxation — natural disasters, and rebel uprisings, the most significant of which was led by Li Zicheng, a former minor official turned rebel leader. His rebellion, which capitalized on the widespread discontent among the peasantry, managed to capture Beijing in April 1644, effectively marking the end of Ming rule in China.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-479911 alt="Ming Tombs" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ming-tombs.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-479911 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Ming Tombs just north of Beijing.</span></p><p>Meanwhile, the Manchu people, under the leadership of the Qing Dynasty, seized this moment of weakness to act. As the Ming government struggled to quell these internal rebellions, the Manchu forces breached the Great Wall and advanced toward the Chinese heartland.</p><p>The Manchus took this opportunity to install themselves as China’s new leaders. While the transition from the Ming Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty was not a smooth one, the Qing would go on to rule until the early 20th century, making it China’s last imperial dynasty.</p><p>After reading about this recent discovery in China, see our list of <a href=#>33 facts about China</a> that will boggle your mind.
