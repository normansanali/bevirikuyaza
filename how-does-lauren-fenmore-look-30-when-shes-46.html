I have tons to say on the subject!!!</p><p>I think that it’s possible she’s had good plastic surgery. I have no idea, but know that more often than not, actors and actresses do have touch ups. It’s kind of worth it for them, considering the nature of the beast that is Hollyweird. How else are they going to compete with the 20 year olds, I suppose. shrug</p><p>If not, she has good genes, takes good care of herself, but who can tell? I’m okay either way. Look at Dierdre Hall (Marlena on Days) She’s like 60 and looks gorgeous. Check out her hands though. Hands tell age, or the neck. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Note to self to start wearing scarves when I’m older!</p><p>Two other things. One, the actors you’re viewing on the screen, truly do not look the same in person. The lighting is a wonder, the thick makeup … all helps make them all look younger, healthier, fills out the lines and makes them look bigger, actually.</p><p>They’re mostly all bone thin in person. It’s shocking. Again, not criticizing, just stating a fact. I’m pretty healthy, pretty curvy. Even most of the men are terribly thin. They worry the camera will make them look heavy. :~ Hollyweird is a horrible place that messes up people’s self esteem. I swear, it has the worst vibe of any place I’ve been. I’m always glad when I leave.</p><p>Keep in mind I’ve been to several Emmy parties, red carpet events, other events, cruise events… Everyone looks different in person, but I have walked by several actors and actresses because I did not recognize them. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>What that means? Some are just very petite, many are very lined, some are just not as attractive. They’re also not their characters and you may find, if you meet them that they’re not as attractive to you, because their own personality is so different. Or this could work for the opposite. I met an actor at a party in June and almost fell over. He was much more gorgeous in person, (Jon Prescott from ATWT) so nice and I didn’t even recognize him when he introduced himself. So it can work both ways.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvHqK5mnJ%2BawG64wK6pnqZdm7Kvuc6rnGakn6S4bn%2BPZq6hnZ5iwKmx0mZrb2dhZ4J5fpM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
