While he may not star in any superhero movies, his selection of indie movies and the occasional blockbuster has clearly benefited his career thus far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Part of his success is due to his charm and personality. Timothee is thought of as a guy who's easy to get along with, as that's something that his co-stars have reiterated time and time again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Timothee Chalamet And Dave Bautista Behind The Scenes On Dune</a></span></p><p>On top of this, Timothee Chalamet has had an interesting love life. At the time of this writing, he's rumored to be dating <a href=#>Kylie Jenner.</a> But he's also dated some actors and had flings with his co-stars. Just who has he been rumored to have been with, and more importantly, which of his fellow cast members has he actually dated?</p><h2 id=did-timothee-chalamet-date-maika-monroe><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Did Timothee Chalamet Date Maika Monroe?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-truth-about-joe-keery-s-ex-girlfriend-s-relationship-with-timothee-chalamet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hot Summer Nights may have had mixed reviews, but critics and audiences alike couldn't deny that Chalamet and Monroe had pretty amazing on-screen chemistry. Fans were curious if Timothee and Maika had some sort of behind-the-scenes romance, even if Monroe was actually dating Stranger Things star Joe Keery.</p><p>It appears that Timothee and Maika are just friends. They've raved about each other in many interviews since, in a way that indicates no hard romantic feelings. For instance, Monroe interviewed with Pylon back in 2018, and claimed that Chalamet's acting was "special". In addition to that, it was reported by People back in October 2022 that Maika and Keery are now engaged. No signs of a Chalamet-Monroe romance here.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maika's set to act in Nic Cage's upcoming film Longlegs</a>, as well as the much anticipated Significant Other movie, so expect her A-list breakout to be coming soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-timothee-chalamet-date-taylor-russell><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Did Timothee Chalamet Date Taylor Russell?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/timoth-e-chalamet-and-taylor-russell-in-bones-and-all-via-collider.jpg><p>2022's Bones And All was Timothee's return to working with Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino. He starred alongside bubbling actress Taylor Russell, and once again, their romance in the movie was so authentic that fans were obsessed with figuring out whether they'd ever dated at all.</p><p>According to DeuxMoi, Chalamet and Russell did actually have a small fling when they worked on Bones And All. However, their relationship was never too serious and was just something the two did for fun. The two actors have never confirmed any rumors of a relationship, and it doesn't seem like they will anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-timothee-chalamet-date-saoirse-ronan><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Did Timothee Chalamet Date Saoirse Ronan?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Saoirse-Ronan-Little-Women.jpg><p>Saoirse has been known for her interesting dynamics with her co-stars. <a href=#>She claimed that she and Sam Rockwell were like "twins"</a> on the set of See How They Run. Her relationship with Timothee is also a bit odd due to how close they've become, but once again, it seems they're just excellent friends.</p><p>Chalamet and Ronan starred in 2018's Lady Bird together, a breakout film for both of them. They've appeared in a couple of other films together, such as Wes Anderson's The French Dispatch, so they've clearly gotten to know one another quite well. Chalamet even told Entertainment Weekly that he was "grateful" to work with her in 2019 and that if he ever writes a book about his life, he'd "dedicate a whole chapter" to Saoirse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ronan once joked about Timothee's dreamy eyes once, but she's busy seeing someone else.

Pugh acted alongside Chalamet in the Dune films, and the two have complimented each other numerous times.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Florence Pugh Really Felt About Working With Timothee Chalamet In Dune</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Vanity Fair, Pugh even compared Chalamet to Leonardo DiCaprio. She simply phrased it "He's our Leo", and kept it at that. Meanwhile, Timothee complimented Pugh in an interview with Variety, calling her an "incredible actor". Maybe he was hinting at the two of them dating in real life? Probably not, as according to Harper's Bazaar, Florence is dating Charlie Gooch after her break-up with Zach Braff.</p><h2 id=did-timothee-chalamet-date-lily-rose-depp><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Did Timothee Chalamet Date Lily Rose-Depp?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lily-Rose-Depp-and-TimothÃ©e-Chalamet.jpg><p>Lily Rose-Depp, the daughter of one Johnny Depp, has appeared in films such as Silent Night, Tusk, and The King. Rose-Depp worked with Chalamet on the latter of the group, which is how they met. Of course, as is the case with most of the girls on this list, fans were highly curious about whether they were dating.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Johnny Depp Feels About Timothee Chalamet Playing A Young Willy Wonka</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Glamour, the two started seeing each other in early 2019 when filming was wrapping up for The King. They shared a lot of PDA when they walked the red carpet for the premiere of the film at the Venice Film Festival, which confirmed in many's eyes that they were a thing. However, their relationship mysteriously ended in 2020 when Chalamet told British Vogue that he was single.</p><p><a href=#>Both Lily and her brother Jack have avoided being labeled nepo babies</a> due to their undeniable talents, and that's certainly part of what Chalamet originally saw in her.</p><h2 id=did-timothee-chalamet-date-zendaya><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Did Timothee Chalamet Date Zendaya?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/zendaya-dune.png><p>According to US Weekly, Tom Holland and Zendaya have been dating since 2020. There couldn't possibly be a relationship between Chalamet and Zendaya then, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once again, it does seem that Chalamet and Zendaya are close to each other - just as friends. They took a BFF test for Buzzfeed Celeb back in 2021, and the two were very playful and joking with each other. Then, in 2022, Timothee claimed that Zendaya was "like a sister" in an interview with Variety.</p><p>Even if Timothee wanted to date Zendaya, she's been very busy with Holland. Tom and Zendaya's relationship <a href=#>is arguably the biggest Gen Z relationship</a>, in part because of how relatable their love is. It doesn't seem like things between them will end anytime soon.</p><h2 id=did-timothee-chalamet-date-jennifer-lawrence><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Did Timothee Chalamet Date Jennifer Lawrence?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jan-mad-at-michael-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lawrence and Chalamet both appeared in the 2021 film Don't Look Up, but Lawrence had been publicly hitting on Chalamet long before the movie was made. For instance, Lawrence thirsted over Chalamet in an interview with Entertainment Tonight all the way back in 2018, claiming that he was 'so hot'.</p><p>The two of them got along well when they made Don't Look Up. Timothee, alongside Don't Look Up co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">served as behind-the-scenes comedic relief</a> for Lawrence when she was stressed out. There doesn't seem any real weight to a relationship between Timothee and Jennifer, although things could always change.</p><h2 id=did-timothee-chalamet-date-armie-hammer><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Did Timothee Chalamet Date Armie Hammer?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Armie-Hammer-and-Timothee-Chalamet-talk-about-Call-Me-By-Your-Name-Sequel.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chalamet and Hammer starred in one of the biggest romance movies of all time, 2017's Call Me By Your Name. Their characters had a memorable relationship, one that was so good that many fans have wondered time and again if they ever dated behind the scenes. Neither Hammer nor Chalamet has publicly come out as gay or bisexual, and there are no major rumors that they were ever romantically interested in each other.</p><p>While Call Me By Your Name's director Luca Guadagnino has expressed interest in a sequel, it's hard to tell given Armie's recent public image. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luca even claimed that Armie's character would have to return</a> if another movie is made, but only time will tell if that will ever happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroqWfqbWmsYycn5qkkaKytXnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjJ2YraGenHqzwcyoqaxlnaTDqrGMnKZmq6SWv7R7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
