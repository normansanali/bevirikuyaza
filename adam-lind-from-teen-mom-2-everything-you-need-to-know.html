He is the father of Chelsea Houska’s daughter Aubree. The two were on-again-off-again for a while before they finally decided to split for good when their daughter was just a toddler. A lot has changed since their 16 and Pregnant episode aired.</p><p>Things have been rocky for the Teen Mom 2 dad. Adam Lind has been <a href=#>arrested</a> several times for violating a protection order against an ex-girlfriend. Chelsea Houska has mentioned him being on drugs several times during the show, though there has been no solid proof of that happening. However, visitation with his daughter is at stake.</p><p>Chelsea Houska is currently married and expecting her third child. Adam Lind went on to have another child after Aubree. His relationship with Taylor Halbur didn’t last long, but it was similar to what fans saw on Teen Mom 2 between him and Chelsea. The two share a daughter, Paislee together.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Adam Lind (@adamjoelind)</a></p><p>Currently, there are <a href=#>reports</a> that Adam Lind is in danger of losing his home following his most recent arrest last month. Things are not looking good for the Teen Mom 2 dad, especially with him apparently not managing to stay out of trouble.</p><p>On the most recent episode of Teen Mom 2,&nbsp; filmed around November 2017, Aubree was able to have her name change approved. She is now Aubree Lind-DeBoer. Taking Cole’s last name was incredibly important to her and Chelsea Houska.</p><p>Lind’s visitation was moved to a supervised center in order to ensure Aubree’s safety.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5GZrq55y6KlnWWWp7yuedOenKdlnaS6bn6Mnq2eqqmptaq6xmawqK1do7KmsIytpmajnqTEcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
