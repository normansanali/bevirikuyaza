When Cameron reappears, he’ll pull a sharp weapon and hold it against Sharon’s neck.</p><p>Cameron will know how this ends for him, but he’ll want to destroy Nick’s life before he goes.</p><p>With that in mind, Cameron will force Nick to decide who lives and who dies.</p><p>In other words, Nick can only save Faith or Sharon – and if he doesn’t decide, Cameron will vow to kill them both.</p><p>Cameron will urge Nick to look under Faith’s sweatshirt, so Nick will be horrified to find an explosive device strapped to her.</p><p>Since the detonator will be near Cameron’s foot, he’ll warn that he can either blow Faith to smithereens or slit Sharon’s throat.</p><p>Back at Sharon’s house, Victor and Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) will find the place looking messy after the showdown earlier.</p><p>Once Victor fires a security guy for not keeping him informed, Nikki will draw his attention to the sewer system schematics.</p><p>Although Nikki will feel it’s too dangerous for Victor to get involved, he’ll insist he has to do this for his family and will dash off to help.</p><p>After Cameron starts a verbal countdown in the sewer, Chance will burst in and point a gun at him.</p><p>Sharon will ultimately grab the knife that’s taped to her leg and stab Cameron in the chest with it.</p><p>“How do I love thee…let me count the ways,” Cameron will say before keeling over next to the detonator that Sharon kicked away during the struggle.</p><p>The Young and the Restless spoilers say some scary moments are still to come for Sharon due to the explosive device, so stay tuned for news on the whole ordeal.</p><p>CDL will have other sizzling <a href=# rel=noopener>Young and the Restless spoilers, news and updates, so make us your one-stop Y&R source.</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>June14/2023 <a rel=nofollow href=#>#yr50</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>#yr</a>🇨🇦spoiler Thurs 🇨🇦Fri 🇺🇸 Preview Next Week <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/gJSqUDYo01</a></p><p>— sharon champagne🇨🇦🤸‍♀️ (@yogachampagne) <a rel=nofollow href=#>June 15, 2023</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybsXOrqWgZZGjsW7Ax55kq52jqbmmv9JmqZ6bkaV6p77InZiyZZqqu6Z5kG9kmpyRonq0rdWeqmarkaG5unnBrqtmpJ%2BosrR5wZqZsmWjna6zu81mnaKmmai1pr%2BMnJimnaKku3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
