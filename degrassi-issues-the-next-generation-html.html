The show has never shied away from splashy or controversial topics, and it might actually be the most progressive series ever when it comes to issues of sex and sexuality. In fact, there’s nothing Degrassi loves more than issues, and dealing with them, and talking about them, and asking a grown-up for help with them, and exploring all the facets of them, and treating everyone with respect. Issues, you guys! These are the 239 issues the show has dealt with so far, in approximately chronological order up through last night’s episode.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text
