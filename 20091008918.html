"I don't do it to make an enormous living or to be a celebrity. I do it because I love acting." Her CV, packed with varied, critically-acclaimed roles which forgo the temptation to get by on her looks, confirms that statement.</p><h2>Her career</h2><p id=e4rBP6BDDT21 data-wc=42>In 2009, big screen drama propelled her from low-budget flicks onto the Hollywood radar when she was nominated for a best actress Oscar for her performance as Ray, a tough, blue-collar mother who smuggles illegal immigrants over the Canadian border.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZ_eiiIsSit data-wc=76>Melissa was born in New York on September 14, 1960, the daughter of teacher Peggy, and fisherman father Arnold Leo. As most of her early life was lived out of the spotlight little is known about it - something which no doubt her Oscar win will change. For many years over the Eighties she was in a relationship with actor John Heard, and the couple had a son together, John Matthew Heard, in 1987.&nbsp;</p><p id=e05yBQvMnzP data-wc=57>Her acting career began on a high note in 1984 when she beat Julia Roberts to the lead role in US soap opera .

Since 1984 Melissa's been a firm fixture on the indie movie scene, making her debut in romantic drama .&nbsp;</p><p id=eAvz_Lzic0o data-wc=70>Her choice of low budget films and small roles meant she was largely off radar, however, until her performance as Benecio del Toro's on-screen wife in brought her widespread attention. Melissa found herself well and truly in the spotlight in 2011, however, when she beat off stiff competition from Helena Bonham-Carter to pick up a best supporting actress gong at the Oscars, for her role in .&nbsp;</p><p id=eFrdcrLj1Lz data-wc=60>"You pinch me?" she asked Kirk Douglas, who presented her with the award - clearly stunned by the fact she had emerged victorious. "Oh wow. really, truly wow," she said. "I know there's a lot of real lovely people who've said a lot of nice things to me for several months, but I'm just shaking in my boots right now."</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_lag0e70>More Profiles:</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9yaWhkuqa4yKyqmmWcmrxw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
