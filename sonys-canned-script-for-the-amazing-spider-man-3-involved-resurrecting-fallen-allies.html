Alas, Marc Webb’s rebooted series, for all of its initial promise, failed to live up to expectations, and poor box office returns meant that all of the plans for spinoffs such as Sinister Six were quickly disbanded.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>However, during San Diego Comic-Con, IGN spoke with Denis Leary – who played Captain Stacy in the films – about the change of hand and the canned plans for <strong>The Amazing Spider-Man 3</strong>.

In accordance with those leaked Sony emails from earlier in the year, it appears the creative team behind Webb’s reboot series were kicking around the idea of resurrecting fallen allies for The Amazing Spider-Man 3.

Gwen Stacy? Or Uncle Ben?</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>It’s fascinating to hear of what could have been had Sony stuck to its guns with Andrew Garfield in the famous suit. Had Webb’s The Amazing Spider-Man series proved to be more of a financial hit, we could have been left facing a completely altered movie landscape regarding the beloved webcrawler.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>Nevertheless, Marvel and Sony’s new-fangled take on our friendly neighbourhood webcrawler (played by Tom Holland) will swing into action for the first time in&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War on March 26, 2016.</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false>As for <strong>The Amazing Spider-Man 3</strong>, what do you make of Sony’s threequel that never was?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqimqah6pK3Np5ydZaOYv6q802adqKpdqbWmecCmmLOhnpx6tLzInZyrZZ2Wu25%2FjKKlr6ecq7KledGeqq6qopqwtbXNoGSfmZyhsq95wKWjop2jZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
