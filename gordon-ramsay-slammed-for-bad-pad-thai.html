In the episode, Ramsay was set to visit the Wimbledon Thai temple in London to cook for Buddhist monks. He stopped by the Blue Elephant restaurant, where head chef Chang was to help him learn how to prepare Thailand’s traditional stir-fried rice noodle dish.</p><p>The MasterChef host, 51, then prepared his “quick and easy” version of the meal. “Can I have a taste? Before you call it pad Thai I have to taste it first,” Chang said, taking a bite and immediately looking disappointed by the TV personality’s cooking.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>YALL IM CRYINGGGGGGGGGG <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SzTb0kkZYz</a></p><p>— Sydnee W.

Look at that face.”</p><p>“This is not pad Thai at all, no. Pad Thai has to be sweet, sour and salty,” Chang responded.</p><p>“I think that doesn’t taste too bad,” Ramsay said defending his dish, “It’s not perfect.”</p><p>Chang then cut in, saying: “For you, but not for me.”</p><p>People have been reacting to the clip with their own take on the interaction between the two chefs. “My parents used to look at me this way,” one <a href=#>Twitter user wrote</a> in reference to Chang’s facial expression.
