She was a model in the ’80s in NYC. She modeled for Soji Health and BeautyBlender and did several commercials as well as a Green Day music video where she appeared in a bikini.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-sports-illustrated></span> Kathy Jacobs Sports Illustrated<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She was selected as a Top 6 finalist for the SI Swimsuit cover and was selected to walk the runway during the 2019 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Runway Show during Miami Swim Week at W South Beach on July 14, 2019, in Miami Beach, Florida.</p><p>She said after the selection: “I am doing this to be part of a change in the views on women over 50, not only by society, but by ourselves. It is a boomerang effect, and we as women over 50 need to stand together and realize how amazing, relevant, beautiful and sexy we all are. It’s time women of all ages unite and claim our power! Ageism impacts all of us, and women of all ages coming together and stopping it now helps prevent future generations from ever experiencing it!”</p><p>SI Swimsuit model Kathy Jacobs strutted down the runway for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit show on the weekend of July 8 to July 11, 2021, which highlighted women of diverse shapes, sizes, ages and backgrounds.</p><p>Jacobs joined Natalie Mariduena, Brooks Nader, Katrina Scott, as well as the 13 Swim Search hopefuls selected for the magazine’s annual open casting call, at the Mondrian Hotel South Beach’s Baia Beach Club during PARAISO Miami Beach.&nbsp;PARAISO Miami Beach is the official platform for swim shows, events and brand launches in Miami from July 8 to July 11.</p><p>The magazine’s highly anticipated issue is scheduled to hit newsstands on July 19. Jacobs came to an open casting call for SI Swimsuit at age 56. She went on to make her debut as part of the 2020 model search. She will appear in this year’s issue. At 5-feet-3-inches, 57-year-old Kathy Jacobs is proudly the “oldest and shortest” Sports Illustrated Swimsuit rookie in the brand’s history. SI Swimsuit was first launched in 1964.</p><p>Jacobs told Fox News appearing in the magazine has been an empowering experience not just for herself, but for other women.&nbsp;“I feel like it’s a stamp of approval not just for me, but for all the women my age out there,” she said. “Being able to represent a lady in my age range is such a huge honor. At our age, we don’t have to hide. I’m honestly so grateful that they let me be in the same magazine with girls who are younger than me, even younger than my own daughter. And yet no one bats an eyelash. You’re treated like everybody else.”</p><p>“Life doesn’t stop when you become a certain age,” she added. “So I feel like being in this magazine not only helps other women my age but younger girls too. Everyone’s so terrified about getting older. I’ve had so many younger girls message me and say, ‘Thank you so much for doing this because I’m not terrified of getting older anymore. I know my life is not going to end once I reach 30, 40, 50 or 60.’”</p><p>“Being in this magazine is really a ripple effect,” noted Jacobs. “It allows people my age to feel beautiful, to feel sexy. It gives us that stamp of approval to feel beautiful and sexy.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-sports-illustrated-photos></span> Kathy Jacobs Sports Illustrated Photos<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/primalinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kathy-Jacobs-Sports-Illustrated.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-skincare></span> Kathy Jacobs Skincare<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>For her skincare routine, Sports Illustrated Swim Search finalist Kathy Jacobs told Sports Illustrated Swimsuit: “I do this twice a day morning/evening in this order: I wash with my Pumpkin enzyme face wash. Then I put everything on from lightest to heaviest in this order: my Multi mist face mist, my Limelight brightening and anti-aging serum, my Time warp face lotion , my Holy grail face oil, my PLUMping oil on my lips and marionette lines.”</p><p>Regarding the beauty products she uses every day, Jacobs said: “I use my own skincare [products made from collagen-friendly ingredients such as pumpkin enzyme, vitamin C, and orchid flower stem cells]. My haircare and vitamins are from Better Not Younger. Sometimes I forget to take the vitamins. I also like Palmers Cocoa Butter Body Oil or lotion.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-skincare-line></span> Kathy Jacobs Skincare Line<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kathy Jacobs owns a skincare products line. “I make all of my own skincare and spent 5 years in my kitchen formulating and developing a skincare line for women over 45,” Kathy told Bored Panda.</p><p>She even went on a TV show called Steve Harvey’s Funderdome to get funding. However, she lost to a girl half her age in a bikini. “I also went to Florida to pitch to HSN but did not get a deal. I’m still hoping to get funding one day to manufacture my skincare line.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-diet></span> Kathy Jacobs Diet<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After her Sports Illustrated photos went viral, Kathy got bombarded with messages asking for dates and diet, workout, and skincare advice.</p><p>“I am not a diet expert,” she told Bored Panda. “I was pre-diabetic and changed the way I eat about 4 years ago.” Kathy doesn’t eat meat and has fish just a couple of times a week. “I drink lots of almond milk because I use it in my coffee and smoothie every day.”</p><p>For breakfast, she usually has a vegan protein smoothie with strawberries or blueberries and meatless sausages. Sometimes she might make eggs with cheese and tomatoes instead. Kathy also eats salads with all different kinds of beans and cheeses for protein. She doesn’t consume sugar but admitted that she’s addicted to Lilly’s sugar-free chocolate chips and peanut butter cups.</p><p>For dinner, she might have spaghetti squash instead of pasta with pesto or tomato sauce or fish. Kathy won’t have bread, pasta, rice, or white potatoes more than once a week, but she really enjoys sweet potatoes.</p><p>“I workout around 4 times a week and have been doing the live Instagram workouts on Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Instagram during the quarantine,” she said. “Before that, I was doing F45 a few times a week and bellydance, which I miss so much!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-botox></span> Kathy Jacobs Botox<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The model admitted she’s experimented with some dermatological boosts, too. “I recently broke down and got a small amount of botox and filler in my marionette lines and lip. I think I needed more filler but dang, it hurts so bad!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-age></span> Kathy Jacobs Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She was born Kathlene Marie Hartsell on January 9, 1964, in Fort Worth, Texas, United States.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-husband></span> Kathy Jacobs Husband<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kathy Jacobs is married to her husband Rob Jacobs.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-daughter-%e2%80%93-kathy-jacobs-children></span> Kathy Jacobs Daughter –&nbsp;Kathy Jacobs Children<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kathy and her husband Rob Jacobs have a daughter, Abigail Rose, who was born in 2003.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-height></span> Kathy Jacobs Height<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kathy Jacobs stands at a height of 5 feet and 3 inches tall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kathy-jacobs-measurements></span> Kathy Jacobs Measurements<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kathy Jacobs stands at a height of 5 feet and 3 inches.
