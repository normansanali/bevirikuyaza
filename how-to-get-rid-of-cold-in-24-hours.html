Drink, drink, drink!</strong></h3><p id=eFXg6R0lPSpH data-wc=23>Keeping hydrated is absolutely vital to help 'flush' out the cold, as well as to break down congestion and keep your throat lubricated.&nbsp;</p><p id=eupNXLk2XZr data-wc=66>Try to avoid sugary or milky drinks, especially if you have a lot of mucus as this can often make it worse. Instead opt for water (sparkling water with lemon can be very refreshing), or soothing warm herbal, or fruit teas. <span><a aria-label="herbal teas" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Herbal teas</a></span> such as sage, ginger, lemon, chamomile, liquorice root, slippery elm and green tea can also help ease a sore, nose or throat problems.</p><p id=eE-Dwr5q8Ea data-wc=17>For those suffering from inflammation of the mucus membranes, fresh turmeric tea is perfect as an anti-inflammatory.</p><h3><strong>2. Up your Vitamin C</strong></h3><p id=eCjPslXf1oOt data-wc=41>This well-known vitamin is extremely helpful when fighting infection, so at the first sign of a cold be sure to increase your intake by eating plenty of berries, citrus fruits, papayas, broccoli and red peppers which will help keep you protected.</p><h3><strong>3. Support the immune system</strong></h3><p id=eAhU4eGLFU-9 data-wc=21>The high-strength Immune + formula contains Andrographis, Echinacea, Olive Leaf, Ginger, Oregano, Vitamin C and Zinc to support the immune system.</p><p id=evUkmF3Ejx_T data-wc=25><strong>IMMUNE SUPPORT:</strong> Andrographis, Zinc and Echinacea support healthy immune system function.

Boil some bones</strong></h3><p id=eSInM2-9iWMO data-wc=28><span><a aria-label="bone broth" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Bone broth</a></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is packed full of nutrients, including gelatine, collagen and a whole host of vitamin and minerals to help heal and get you back on your feet.&nbsp;</p><p id=elhceH2xsdz data-wc=40>Add some garlic for its powerful anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-catarrhal properties, and some chilli, which acts as a natural decongestant. Turmeric, cinnamon and a dash of fresh ginger can also be added and will help to speed up your metabolism.</p><h3><strong>5. Use a supplement</strong></h3><p id=eG7c4XBAxANe data-wc=46>A melt-in-the-mouth supplement such as <span><a aria-label="new era" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">New Era Q</a></span> can help to ward off symptoms of catarrh and sinus disorders, while <span><a aria-label="new era j" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">New Era J</a></span> can help those suffering from more general cold symptoms. When taken together, they promise to offer the ultimate protection from colds and flu.</p><p id=eo68So9pnpWk data-wc=44>The importance of having the right supplements can't be underestimated for immune health. Through common colds, flu season and COVID-19, scientific evidence has made it clear that the right combination of vitamins really can make a difference to how your body fights off infections.</p><p id=eNvmMymq6RfP data-wc=42>Margo Marrone, Founder/CEO of The Organic Pharmacy and Homeopath, says she "wanted to combine the most important vitamins that were proven to help with the immune system and specifically the respiratory system, so (she) could provide some support during these unsettling times."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9d858e7c72ac-immune-boost-duo-z.jpg><p id=ei4CXh1jCjPD data-wc=63>The Immune Boosting Day Supplement is rich in Vitamin A, D & C which all contribute to a properly functioning immune system. Vitamin A specifically helps the body fight off illness and infections, Vitamin C protects cells and aids their function and Vitamin D contributes to reducing tiredness and fatigue as well as being essential for the overall health of bones and muscles.</p><p id=e8tgMW0am8r8 data-wc=73>The Immune Boosting Night Supplement supports the body's ability to relax and therefore aids in quality of sleep. Seeing that the second arm of the immune system is a proper night's sleep, it is important that it doesn't get neglected. Infection-fighting antibody production is enhanced by deep relaxation and adequate amounts of rest. This spectacular mixture of magnesium and herbs reduces anxiety and allows the body to recover through a deep night's sleep.</p><p id=euM_8VrKYAa data-wc=17><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Why the royals are at risk of illness this winter: Princess Kate, Duchess Sophie and more...&nbsp;</a></p><h3><strong>6. Step outside</strong></h3><p id=eDZKtx_yuX5i data-wc=18>When it comes to combating a cold, Vitamin D is essential in helping to regulate an immune response.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoJ8qqllQe9 data-wc=47>During the colder months, many people become deficient in Vitamin D because they stay inside avoiding the weather but you need to make sure you expose yourself to the sun's UVB rays by going outside for at least 15 minutes per day - even if it's chilly.&nbsp;</p><p id=etGxFIIFTAb data-wc=39>For those unable to do so, a great alternative is opting for <span><a aria-label="vitamin tablets" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">vitamin D3 supplements</a></span>. Taking one daily not only boosts the immune system and fights infection but can also help with depression, bone and joint and heart health.</p><h3><strong>7. Stock up on Zinc</strong></h3><p id=etdxXSoOGspF data-wc=49>Try to incorporate plenty of zinc-rich foods in your diet, including pumpkin seeds, spinach, beef, wheat germ and cocoa. This is because the zinc will decrease the time period of the symptoms you are experiencing. You can also take a good quality supplement such as a <span><a aria-label=zinc class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Zinc Citrate</a></span> daily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7df8f6a8c36b-woman-asleep-alarm-clock.jpg><h3><strong>8. Try Pelargonium</strong></h3><p id=exh041sUkbge data-wc=42><span><a aria-label=pelargonium class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Pelargonium</a></span> is a natural, herbal remedy which can help with respiratory infections, sore throats and general cold and flu symptoms. Take this remedy as soon as you begin to feel the onset of illness and continue until you see signs of improvement.</p><h3><strong>9. Take it easy</strong></h3><p id=efNTufDrenee data-wc=53>We all think we are invincible and push forward no matter what but when feeling under the weather ensure you take some time out, turn off the Wi-Fi, grab the duvet, relax and de-stress. This not only feels good but can also boost your immune system. The perfect excuse for a lazy day!</p><h3><strong>10. Sleep</strong></h3><p id=eQawJQcv7V-y data-wc=55>But, don't just think you're resting because you're chilling out. Getting actual sleep is key as it will help your body to restore faster and fight off infection. This is your free pass to take multiple naps in addition to having a fair few early nights. If you need a helping hand, you should try...</p><h3><strong>11. Add moisture to the air</strong></h3><p id=e6xExs4sIJag data-wc=50>Winter is radiation season which means your house can become really dry leading to throat irritation. Of course, it's probably too cold to turn it off altogether but counter it by adding a <span><a aria-label=humidifier class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">humidifier</a></span> to introduce some moisture into the air too. It could really help loosen up your congestion.</p><h3><strong>12. Buy some honey</strong></h3><p id=evI3HcuqygOU data-wc=47>Research suggests <span><a aria-label=honey class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">honey</a></span> is more effective than many over-the-counter medicines. Honey has long been used as a home remedy to treat coughs and colds, but it's often believed to work more on kids. Recent studies suggest it can improve symptoms, particularly the frequency and severity of coughing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a4cec9176f1b-honey-amazon-z.jpg><h3>13. Take a relaxing bath</h3><p id=evjcp5uDsftOi data-wc=45>A warm bath can reduce a fever and ease any aches or pains. Try adding <span><a aria-label="Epsom salt" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Epsom Salt</a></span> and a few drops of essential oils (chamomile is ideal) mixed with a carrier oil like olive or coconut to soothe your body and help to remove toxins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2d5fb4fb762e-epsom-salts-z.jpg><h3>14. Wash your hands frequently</h3><p id=e0tama9rh51Qw data-wc=38>It sounds obvious, but washing your hands properly and regularly will both prevent colds and reduce the severity if you already have the virus. This hand wash from INEOS has a moisturising formula and a gorgeous stress-reducing scent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45rZ2pvYWV9d4CSaWdpZ5ikxG7Azmaenqxdp7alec6fZJynnJl6qrqMa2tmoJ%2Bqv7R7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
