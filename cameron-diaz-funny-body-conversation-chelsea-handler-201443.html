The former model, 41, who has been on a “love your amazing body” tour since releasing her Body Book, returned the favor by remarking about Handler’s “hot body.”</p><p>In her tome, Diaz goes into detail about her struggles with acne, and even more depth about the <a href=#>female anatomy in a chapter titled</a>, “In Praise of Pubes.”</p><p>Holding a copy of The Body Book Monday night, Handler opened up to the chapter and quipped, “There’s a diagram of your labia and for me, the vagina is such an integral part of the body.”</p><p>“You’re supposed to treat it like the beautiful flower that it is, the delicate flower that it is,” Diaz continued. “You’re supposed to nurture it in all the ways it needs nurturing.”</p><p>“In essence, we should be watering it,” Handler responded. “Fertilizing it,” said Diaz. “It needs nourishment, it’s hungry.” Handler, an author herself of the bestselling book, Are You There Vodka? It’s Me Chelsea, told her roaring audience, “You have to keep it clean you guys.”</p><p>Diaz, who then provided a brief summary of her “In Praise of Pubes” excerpt, explained to Handler: “I figure there’s a purpose for that hair.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“No matter how you enjoy grooming it throughout your life, whether it’s like shave it all off, wax it all off, put a bullseye, birthday cake, I don’t care. Just girls, think about not taking it all off forever. Permanency forever, ever, means forever. It doesn’t come back,” Diaz said, urging against eloctrolysis, laser hair removal, and similar measures.</p><p>“And then you break up with guy who likes it now, and you start to date a guy who don’t like that, and then your stuck,” the Other Woman star said of a hypothetical dating scenario.</p><p>Watch and tell <strong>Us</strong> what you think of Diaz’s advice!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacmZ2av7C6jJ2gmrJdm8KvuthmmaicqWKwsLrVnqmsmaSevK95wqGcpauVlnqprc2do56qXWd9coCTbGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
