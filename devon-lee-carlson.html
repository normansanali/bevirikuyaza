She says:</p><p>If I was to receive a grant, I would want to donate it to a non-profit that works to protect abused, abandoned, ill and in danger dogs. One in particular that I support and admire is Marley’s Mutts. As a dog owner (Martin is my child), it’s heart-breaking to see so many dogs being abused/neglected with no way out. People need to realise that we aren’t the only species in this world and need to respect/protect other mammals.</p><h2><span id=Devon_Lee_Carlson_8211_Body_Measurements>Devon Lee Carlson – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>She stands tall at a <strong>height</strong> of approximately 5 feet 8 inches and her weight is around 54 kg or 120 pounds.</p><p>Likewise, her chest-waist-hip measures are 34-22-34 inches respectively.
