His departure in 2019 came as a major shock to fans, especially as the character was fatally shot while investigating his brother's death. Naturally, the actor has been asked about his exit on numerous occasions, but in 2021 he revealed the truth behind his decision.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/21e3c081e17b-lasalle-in-hospital-ncis-orleans.jpg><p id=epEX121Qz4L data-wc=36>Speaking to Lee Domingue on his podcast 'Legacy Starts Today,' Lucas explained that he had quit NCIS: New Orleans after realizing that it was affecting his family life with his wife, Maggie, and their three children.&nbsp;</p><p id=epSJihMCVcK data-wc=42>"All throughout my career there was a concern because I would observe how the entertainment industry would destroy families, and destroy families," he said.
