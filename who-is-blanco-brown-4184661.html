He went viral in 2019 with ‘The Git Up’ Challenge. </strong>Blanco went viral when he posted the music video for his now-hit song “The Git Up”. The video (<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>watch HERE</a>), featured country artist <strong>Lainey Wilson</strong>, and showed the two men teaching people how to do the dance described in the song. Tens of thousands of TikToks later, he was a worldwide, country- hip hop <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>crossover sensation</a>, in the company of artists like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lil Nas X</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>2. He’s a record producer and songwriter. </strong>Before releasing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his own songs</a>, Blanco wrote and produced songs for some major hip-hop artists. He co-wrote and produced <strong>Monica</strong>‘s “Suga” and <strong>Pitbull</strong>‘s “Goalie Goalie”. He also co-wrote or wrote <strong>Malachiae Warren</strong>‘s “Do 2 U”; <strong>2 Chainz</strong>‘ “Burglar Bars”; <strong>Case</strong>‘s “Therapy”; <strong>Demetria McKinney</strong>‘s “Sextraordinary” and “No, No, No”; and <strong>Raheem DeVaughn</strong>‘s “Metronome”, “Black Girl Magic”, and “K.I.N.G.” He produced <strong>Fergie</strong>‘s “M.I.L.F. $” as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blanco-brown-5-things-mega-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>3. His biggest influences as an artist are Johnny Cash and Outkast.</strong> Growing up in Atlanta, and spending the summers in the Georgia countryside, Blanco got a taste for two entirely different genres of music — and loved them equally. He’s stated that <strong>Johnny Cash</strong> and <strong>Outkast</strong> are two of his faves, along with Tim McGraw — more on him below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>4. He credits his grandmother for his love of country music. </strong>When Blanco was a kid, he would visit family in rural Georgia. It was there where he came to have an appreciation for country music artists like&nbsp;<strong>Tim McGraw</strong>. Blanco actually told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a> in 2019 that “The Git Up” was dedicated to both of his grandmothers. They would yell “Git up!” at him first thing in the morning! “You had to get outside and be productive, find purpose and enjoy and just celebrate as a kid,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blanco-brown-5-things-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>5. He has more new music in the works. </strong>There’s much more to come from Blanco after his first album, Honeysuckle & Lightning Bugs. “I got 80, 90 tracks ready to go,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TIME</a> in 2019. “The second album [is going to] be mastered. I’m just adding more elements or changing up things. I haven’t changed anything of the formula, because I didn’t just make up a formula. I know my sound is different sonically, because I’ve been a consumer of all my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kvra3NnKZmmqKkxK95k2pvbW5mZnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
