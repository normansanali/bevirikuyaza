At least they should know what all legal tender in the U.S. looks like. Imagine if I had tried to use a $2 bill or silver dollar for that matter,” the caption reads.</p><p>As the video starts, a frustrated Kasey sits in her car and tells her story.</p><p>“I just left a store here in New Hampshire and I have $142 worth of merchandise. I tried to check out and the 18-year-old — I know because she told me how old she was — behind the register refused to take my money,” Kasey says as she shows the $100 bill.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kaseybay326 href=#>@kaseybay326</a><p>it's bad enough they can't tell time, address an envelope or make change ... at least they should know what all legal tender in the US looks like - Imagine if I had tried to use a $2 bill or silver dollar for that matter <a title=dobetteramerica href=#>#dobetteramerica</a> <a title=whatareweteachingthem href=#>#whatareweteachingthem</a> <a title=old100dollarbill href=#>#old100dollarbill</a> <a title=kaseybay href=#>#kaseybay</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Kasey Lee" href=#>♬ original sound - Kasey Lee</a></figure><p>“Because she said it wasn’t real,” Kasey said. “She saw the date, she saw 1990 and advised me that they didn’t make $100 bills back in 1990.”</p><p>Kasey shows the $100 bill once again and said, “I asked her to get her manager.”</p><p>Once the manager arrived, they were also aligned with the cashier.</p><p>“Her manager came over and is 26 years old.
