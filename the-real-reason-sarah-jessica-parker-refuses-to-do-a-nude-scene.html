Simply put, she just doesn't feel comfortable doing it. "I don't have any judgment about anyone who chooses to do it," the <a href=#>Divorce</a> actress explained to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "I think it's fantastic that people feel comfortable doing it. It's not some kind of principled position or religious or ideological on my part."</p><p>In 2018, she did, however, recall her career beginnings and the traumatizing setbacks she faced. Speaking to <a href=#>People</a>, Parker revealed that she had once sobbed on the set of a movie after filmmakers tried to push her into doing a nude scene.&nbsp;"I don't know if I had confidence or if I was being counseled by people. There was so much pressure for me to take my clothes off." Luckily for the starlet, she had one very important figure standing up for her. "My agent [CAA's Kevin Huvane] sent a car and a plane ticket [to the film set] and he said, 'If anybody makes you do anything that you're not comfortable doing, you don't.' Given what's happening now and the stories told from that particular period, I know how lucky I am that there was someone — in this case, a man — who stepped in."</p><p>Over the years, Parker has stood her ground, enjoyed success&nbsp;as a Hollywood A-lister and launched a&nbsp;<a href=#>lucrative business</a>.&nbsp;Kudos to SJP for staying true to herself!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9obX55e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2orrOtx2ahnqujnrCiec%2BaqaSdomK%2FprLUrJysZaSkeqW7jJpkp62Umnq0r8SnnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
