The all-boy Korean pop band stole our hearts back in 2013 and has refused to give them back since, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even during their temporary break from the limelight</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>I’m emphasizing the word ‘temporary,’ of course, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">because ARMY hasn’t had a moment to rest</a> since BTS announced a break from group activities. But hey, we’re not complaining. After all, every time we think there’s no way we can fall more in love with them, they continuously prove us wrong, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">whether it’s through a new album</a>, song, or just a simple Weverse live making us swoon.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>As a matter of fact, Jungkook <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently shared his birth time</a> during a live stream – probably regretting it afterwards, because you can bet I ran to find out all about his birth chart. Unfortunately, we don’t have as many details about the other members, but here’s what we do know: their zodiac signs.</p><h2 id=h-jin-sagittarius-dec-4-1992 data-injectable=false>Jin – Sagittarius (Dec. 4, 1992)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jin of BTS (@jin)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>Jin is a Sagittarius through and through. Yes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he might be the oldest member of BTS</a>, but we all know the ‘hyung’ of the group can be as immature as Jungkook – the chaotic duo. Jin is known for his self-confidence and larger-than-life personality, two common traits for Sagittarians.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>Despite being bright and talkative during interviews, both ARMY and BTS know that Jin is an introvert at the end of the day, which makes sense considering Sagittarians can be painfully shy. Sagittarians are also known for their sense of adventure, and even though he’s not exactly BTS’ most adventurous member, he’s constantly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">challenging himself musically and artistically</a>.</p><h2 id=h-suga-pisces-march-9-1993 data-injectable=false>Suga – Pisces (March 9, 1993)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by SUGA of BTS 민윤기 (@agustd)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>It’s actually rather funny how perfectly BTS members fit into their zodiac mold. Min Yoongi, AKA Suga, is the only water sign of the group, and even though he often tries to play it cool and appear coy, we can all see right through him and his sensitive persona. Over the years, the members have long debunked the idea that Suga is a stone-hearted person.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>If anything, he shows as much empathy and compassion as every Pisces around the world, evident <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">through his raw lyrics showing how in touch he is with his emotions</a> – though at the end of the day, he’s the most introverted member in the group. He also perfectly embodies several other Pisces traits, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">including his endless creativity</a> – after all, he couldn’t be one of BTS’ main producers otherwise.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>J-Hope – Aquarius (February 18, 1994)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by jhope (@uarmyhope)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>Much like all the other members, Jung Hoseok AKA J-Hope is the perfect textbook Aquarius. There’s no doubt that J-Hope is the sunshine of BTS. His bright and positive personality is infectious, and he always seems to be surrounded by an aura of happiness, but don’t be fooled by his happy-go-lucky exterior.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Like all Aquarians, J-Hope’s primary focus is on his creativity, evident in his work. His extroverted personality shouldn’t be mistaken for an easy-going work ethic – on the contrary. He’s one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most intimidating members when it comes to his life’s work and his passion</a>, taking it more seriously than most could have imagined. That is, until you see him on stage – then <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it suddenly all makes sense</a>.</p><h2 id=h-rm-virgo-sept-12-1994 data-injectable=false>RM – Virgo (Sept. 12, 1994)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by RM (@rkive)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>Kim ‘RM’ Namjoon was born on September 12, making him a Virgo – the oldest Virgo in the group. Virgos are known to be hard workers and perfectionists, which perfectly describes RM and his incessant work ethic. Not only is he a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">producer, rapper, and the main songwriter of BTS</a>, but he’s also the leader of the group for his linguistic abilities and for being the voice of reason – traits typical of most Virgos.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>This zodiac sign is also known for being incredibly gifted in whatever they set their minds to, making it all the more obvious that RM’s musical genius hails from the many traits he shares with Virgos. Also, let’s be honest – only a Virgo would reach this level of success, all while being a math genius.</p><h2 id=h-jimin-libra-oct-13-1995 data-injectable=false>Jimin – Libra (Oct. 13, 1995)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JIMIN (@j.m)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Our third youngest member is Jimin, and he’s the perfect embodiment of a Libra from the get-go. His infectious personality proves that Libras are social butterflies and empaths at heart. He’s one of the more extroverted members of BTS, and is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">always ready to swoon everyone around him with his charms</a> and flirty nature – he is a Libra through and through.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>Much like Virgos, Libras are perfectionists and have a keen eye for detail, always striving for harmony in aesthetics. This notion immediately brings to mind Jimin, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">whose style is always on point</a>, and who’s known for being an intense worker always striving for perfection – even if we can tell he’s never content with the final result.</p><h2 id=h-v-capricorn-dec-30-1995 data-injectable=false>V – Capricorn (Dec. 30, 1995)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by V (@thv)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>Kim Taehyung, AKA V, is the group’s only Capricorn. Capricorns are known to be ambitious and hardworking, traits that match V – to some degree. He does work hard – otherwise he wouldn’t be in BTS – but he’s more naturally talented than particularly hardworking. Once he’s on stage, we can tell that he’s like that annoying classmate we all have, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">effortlessly excelling at everything he does</a>.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Capricorns are also known for their sense of humor and unique train of thought, which perfectly describes how V is considered to be the ‘alien’ of the group, constantly thinking outside the box, all while maintaining a fun and easy-going nature, cracking jokes, and playing with his bandmates.</p><h2 id=h-jungkook-virgo-sept-1-1997 data-injectable=false>Jungkook – Virgo (Sept. 1, 1997)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by BTS official (@bts.bighitofficial)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Jungkook is the second Virgo of the group, and while he shares the same zodiac sign as RM, they manifest it in entirely different ways. While RM’s practicality and level-headedness shine through, Jungkook is far more irrational than his leader – which makes sense, given that he is the youngest member and tends to be coddled by his bandmates.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=850 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, he shares Virgo’s most prominent trait – perfectionism. Jungkook is known as the “golden maknae” for his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">innate talent to excel at everything he does</a>, but it also comes with incessant hard work behind it – befitting of a Virgo. In a fun twist, despite being the youngest of the group, Jungkook’s Virgo-esque nature is also obvious when it comes to his home chores, as he’s often seen cleaning up after everyone else and folding his laundry very tidily.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46tn6KrXZ7AbrHAnJ9mmqSoeq6xzJucq6tdr7yltcCcZKyhl6N8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
