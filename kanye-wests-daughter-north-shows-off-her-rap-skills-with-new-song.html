More recently, Kardashian, 43, posted a video to their shared TikTok account where they lip-synced to West’s song “Bound 2.”</p><p>The former couple share North, Saint, 7, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4. West and Kardashian called it quits in February 2021 following nearly seven years of marriage. After <a href=#>their divorce was finalized</a> in November 2022, the reality star offered a candid look at the challenges of coparenting with West.</p><p>“I had the best dad. I don’t want to get emotional, but it’s just been a day for me. It is hard. Coparenting is really f—king hard,” she shared on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast one month later. “I had the best dad and the best experiences, and that is all I want for my kids. As long as they can have that, that is what I want for them.”</p><p>In a November episode of Hulu’s <a href=#>The Kardashians</a>, Kardashian shared more insight, including how North <a href=#>has chosen favorites</a> when it comes to her parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kanye-West-s-Daughter-North-Makes-Surprise-Appearance-at-His-Event-to-Debut-Her-New-Song-Verse.jpg><p>“North will go to her dad’s and she [will say], ‘Dad’s is the best. He has it all figured out. He doesn’t have a nanny or a chef or security. He lives in an apartment,'” Kim said in a joint confessional with <strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong>. “And she will start crying, ‘Why don’t you have an apartment? I can’t believe we don’t have an apartment.'”</p><p>Kourtney, 44, reflected on her own experience with kids Mason, 13, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 8, whom she shares with ex <strong>Scott Disick</strong>. (The Posh founder welcomed son Rocky with husband <strong>Travis Barker</strong> in November.)</p><p>“They do that at Scott’s too. Like, ‘Dad has the best house. Your house sucks. He has the best house, it is not super big. The vibes are better,'” Kourtney said. “I feel like everything falls on the parent that is more involved.”</p><p>In response, Kim poked fun at why her children have openly favored their father. “They make their own food. That is amazing that you make Ramen,” she quipped, to which Kourtney added, “You boil water and pour it onto some noodles.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In a separate episode, Kim detailed her attempt to <a href=#>hire a caretaker</a> for her kids. “I recently hired a manny [male nanny] because I really wanted a male around that was going to be picking them up and taking them to sports,” she said in an October episode. “I was scared out of my mind to tell their dad that.”</p><p>Kim continued: “When he was dropping off the kids, Kanye introduced himself and played [soccer] with Saint and him. He was so nice to him. He said, ‘Hey, if you are going to help raise my son …’ Because [the nanny] handed [Saint] the ball really easily and [Kanye] said, ‘Don’t do that. Make him go get it himself. These are some of the rules I would want.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakmZ6usm7DxKyrrGWUlsKotNOeqWamn6fBqXnSoaawq12ks6d5x56pZqqRpXq0t8ilo6xlp57BqXnNnq5mq5%2BjtHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
