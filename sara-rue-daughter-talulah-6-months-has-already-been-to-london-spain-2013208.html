"It's been really fun," Malibu Country's Rue, 34, told <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a> </strong>of motherhood at Project Angel Food's Angel Awards Aug. 11 in Los Angeles. "We've travelled. We took her to London, and I was a bridesmaid in my friend's wedding [in Spain] so we took her to Majorca."</p><p>Vowing to take the first six months off post-pregnancy from work to bond with Talulah, Rue tells <strong>Us</strong> she's in no immediate rush to get back in front of the cameras. "I'm starting to think about what I'll do next. I'm such a slacker," the busy new mom joked to <strong>Us</strong>. (Rue's Malibu Country, costarring <strong>Reba McEntire</strong>, was canceled in May 2013.)</p><p>Instead, Rue is soaking up the moments with her little girl. "She's sitting up and starting to blow bubbles," Rue beams of Talulah's recent milestones. "The first forming of the word 'mom' are coming any day now. She's a total angel baby."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As her daughter stays active, so does Rue, who has begun the process of slimming to her pre-baby weight. "It's a slow crawl back," reasons Rue, who <a href=# rel=noopener>told <strong>Us</strong> in March</a> that she wasn't looking for a "hot bod" and instead just wanted to be a healthy role model for her daughter.</p><p>Making the <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> journey easier for the actress is Paleta's Fit Mommy meal plan, which offers farm-to-table meal delivery options. "Their meals are very normal. It's just clean, healthy food and it's working," raves Rue. "It's like anything else [with weight loss], it works when you work it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasmaKWerPBxGabmq2XncGmvoytmKWtnJa1boKMpqanrJioeqmt0maYpaqVlrG6ecGenKdlpKR6rbvNnaanZaOlrqq6jGtnamtiZYVw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
