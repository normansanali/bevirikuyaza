Landon is known for being a young man who loves sports and is quite athletic. The accident took place late on a Saturday night, and the local authorities were called to the scene to help the victims who had suffered injuries from the crash. <strong>Landon Cromer was taken to the hospital in critical condition, while the other two individuals involved are in stable condition. Currently, Landon is in a very serious condition and is fighting for his life at the hospital.</strong></p><p>It’s important to note that his passing has not been confirmed at this time, so it’s best to avoid making any assumptions and instead join in offering prayers and support for Landon and his family. <strong>Updates on Landon’s condition will be provided as soon as they become available.</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Audra Neve Ferguson shared a heartfelt message on her Facebook post:</p><p><strong>Please keep The Cromer Family in your thoughts and prayers.
