This eventually led to Tony Khan <a href=#>firing CM Punk from AEW</a>, but Punk came back to WWE at Survivor Series a couple of days ago. Now many believe that Triple H exposed AEW with CM Punk’s return.</p><p>The Second City Saint made his triumphant return to WWE following the<a href=#>&nbsp;WarGames match at the Survivor Series Premium Live Event</a>&nbsp;– something that didn’t fail to electrify the WWE Universe in a major way.</p><p>CM Punk and The Elite had a lot of issues right from their backstage brawl at AEW All Out last year, which essentially sowed the seeds of Punk’s eventual departure. While speaking on his <a href=#>Jim Cornette Experience</a>&nbsp;podcast, Jim Cornette talked about CM Punk’s return.</p><p>The pro wrestling veteran explained that Triple H exposed AEW by having CM Punk return to WWE, as Triple H showed the world that WWE was ready to work with a man that the AEW EVPs called a cancer. He highlighted now CM Punk will main event WrestleMania next year – dealing another blow to AEW.</p><p>“The point is, they smell this s***er’s blood in the water and they’re chomping on it because now, Triple H has told everybody in AEW, yeah the guy that your EVPs said was a cancer and they couldn’t get along under any circumstances. They didn’t wanna speak to, they didn’t wanna meet with, they didn’t wanna work with, they didn’t wanna make up with, and their friends and minions hounded him and badgered him until finally he facelocked one of them, well now, he’s gonna main event WrestleMania.”</p><p>Even AEW President <a href=#>Tony Khan has broken his silence regarding CM Punk’s WWE return</a> at the Survivor Series Premium Live Event. CM Punk recently&nbsp;<a href=#>signed long-term deal with WWE</a>&nbsp;just before Survivor Series Premium and is also scheduled to appear on this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW. It remains to be seen whether AEW will be able to counter what WWE has managed to do.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your opinion on what Jim Cornette said?
