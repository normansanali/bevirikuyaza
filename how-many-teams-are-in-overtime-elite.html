OTE was founded by sports media company Overtime and is based in the United States. It is the first professional basketball league to target high school players and offers them a pathway to the pros without having to go through the traditional college route.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>OTE provides a holistic approach to player development by focusing not only on basketball skills but also on education, life skills, and personal growth. The league aims to prepare young athletes for the challenges they may face both on and off the court.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Number of Teams in Overtime Elite</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>As of now, Overtime Elite has not officially announced the number of teams that will be part of the league. However, the league has stated that it plans to launch with a limited number of teams in its inaugural season. This decision is likely due to various factors, including logistics, player availability, and ensuring a competitive balance within the league.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While the exact number of teams remains undisclosed, it is expected that Overtime Elite will start with a small number of teams, possibly between four to eight teams. This limited number of teams allows for a more focused and controlled environment where players can receive the attention and development they need.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>It is important to note that the Overtime Elite league is in its early stages, and as the league gains traction and expands, the number of teams may increase. Overtime Elite has ambitious plans to become a prominent league in the world of basketball, and part of that growth may involve adding more teams to the league.</p><h2>Team Structure and Composition</h2><p>Although the exact number of teams is not confirmed, we can speculate on the possible team structure and composition based on industry trends and the league's vision. Each team in Overtime Elite is likely to consist of a roster of talented high school athletes who have chosen to forgo their college eligibility in pursuit of a professional basketball career.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The teams will be coached by experienced basketball professionals who will be responsible for the players' development and overall team performance. These coaches will play a crucial role in nurturing young talent and helping them reach their full potential.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Given the league's emphasis on a comprehensive education, each team is also expected to have academic support staff to ensure that players receive quality education alongside their basketball training. This support will likely include tutors, mentors, and other educational resources to help players excel academically.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>As Overtime Elite aims to revolutionize the development and professional opportunities for high school basketball players, the exact number of teams in the league remains undisclosed. However, it is expected that OTE will begin its inaugural season with a limited number of teams, possibly between four to eight.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While the league's initial team count may be small, it is likely to grow over time as Overtime Elite establishes itself as a prominent basketball league.
