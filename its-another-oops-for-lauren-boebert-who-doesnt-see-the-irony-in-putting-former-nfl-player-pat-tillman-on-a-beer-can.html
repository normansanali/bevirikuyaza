Boebert, who is short on ideas but big on pointing fingers, tried to make a point about the recent Bud Light boycott boycotts by conservatives over a special can for trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney, by posting an image of deceased NFL player Pat Tillman.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>Boebert shared a doctored image of the fallen Tillman on a can of Bud Light with a caption saying this is what people really wanted. Take a look:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LJW5HT24kM</a></p>— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) <a href=#>April 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Boebert, who nobody ever accused of being smart, once again acted out of emotion and not fact. Unfortunately, fact doesn’t seem to matter to much but let’s go over it anyway. The story of Tillman is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tragic one</a>. He was an NFL player for the Arizona Cardinals, but he left that all behind to serve in the Army Rangers after Sept. 11.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>He served two tours: one in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. In April of 2004, the Army said Tillman was killed saving a bunch of his fellow soldiers from an ambush. This turned out to be not the full truth: Tillman was killed by his own unit as they shot at him under the assumption he was a guerilla.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>The Army wanted to make him a martyr, but the truth came out after Tillman’s mother went through thousands of pages of documents about her son’s death. In the book Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman, journalist <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jon Krakauer revealed</a> just how far the Army went to cover up Tillman’s death, and how he felt about serving his country.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>“It may be very soon that Nub [his brother Kevin] & I will be called upon to take part in something I see no clear purpose for… I believe we have little or no justification other than our imperial whim,” he wrote. He also called the rescue of captured POW Jessica Lynch “a publicity stunt.”</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>After he was killed, his clothes and his notebook with some thoughts on gender were burned in a fire. Tillman reportedly supported the LGBTQA community and said “good” when his college coach told him he would allow gay players on the team.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>So what we have is a man who would be considered a leftist and who would probably have supported Bud Light’s decision. We also have a woman who didn’t finish high school and only got a GED before she was elected, trying to make a point but missing the boat completely.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Author Jeff Sharlet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared her image and said</a>, “My guess is Boebert doesn’t even know this is Pat Tillman, a leftist killed by friendly fire. I suspect she chose the image just for the jaw, the imaginary militant eroticism of fascism.”</p><p data-characters=51 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Here’s another pretty good own by Ryan Shead.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Of course Lauren Boebert doesn’t know that Pat Tillman was an atheist who didn’t want to be the military’s poster boy.</p><p>…he was also shot in the head 3 times by friendly fire.</p><p>These donuts need to stop setting their political soapbox up on the caskets of American soldiers,… <a href=#>https://t.co/ZAMlqLyeJe</a></p>— Ryan Shead (@RyanShead) <a href=#>April 18, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>As long as politicians keep putting culture wars and division ahead of actually governing, we’re never going to make any progress in this country. Politicians used to boast about crossing the aisle and being able to work together. Now people like Boebert just stoke fires and make noise. Oh, and lie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tb%2BMmqWorJiav267zqmqZp6fp3qtrdSrnKdlkqSyo7HRrWSwoJ9isbCx0qerZquVmnq1tMRmoKunnq56qrqMqaytrJmjtG6yzquknqpdo7Otec%2BlmLKdomK9osCMraClpJ2Wu267zWaYZpqVmr9ur8CnZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
