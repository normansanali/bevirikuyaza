(Unmentioned in patch notes) Demons can now spawn on the surface. Categories: Enemies.</p><h2>Are there mutants in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>Mutants are a special, stronger type of enemy in Sons of the Forest. Currently, there are four known variants of cannibals.

Instead, it shows how close you are to reaching the next strength level.</p><h2>What is the girl for in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>Virginia is a three-legged and three-armed mutant lady who can fight alongside the players and aid them in various ways like hunting, gathering food items etc. Virginia’s three arms make her a formidable fighter against the cannibals in the game and she can hold two weapons at once.</p><h2>Can you befriend mutants in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>Virginia is a human mutant with three arms and legs who can become a companion in Sons of the Forest. She’ll occasionally approach you as you’re building your shelter, or even exploring the island, but she gets easily frightened from any of your sudden movements.</p><h2>Is the blob in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>Sluggy or The Blob, named after its sheer size, distorted features, and similarity to a giant slug, is an enemy in Sons of the Forest. As a creepy mutant, it appears to be within a bunker.</p><h2>Can you beat Sons of Forest?</h2><p>Entering the cube will trigger the final cutscene, after which players get to decide on one of two endings. They can either leave the island with the once-missing billionaire or continue exploring the mysteries the island holds. With that, players have not only survived but beaten Sons of the Forest.</p><h2>Who is Virginia in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>Virginia Puffton is a non-playable character in Sons of the Forest. Alongside Kelvin, she is one of two known player companions. However, unlike Kelvin, she is initially wary of the player and must slowly be befriended to get to a similar relationship.</p><h2>Can you scare cannibals in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>Regular Cannibals, being the base type of Cannibal, can be scared off. As shown in the 3rd Sons of the Forest trailer, Cannibals held at gunpoint will hesitate to attack the player.</p><h2>Is the worm in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>John 2.0 also known as the “Caterpillar”, “Worm 2.0”, or “CatDog Mutant” are a creepy mutant in Sons of the Forest. Once close enough, they will swing one half of the body at the player knocking the player over.</p><h2>Can you arm Kevin in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>Sons of the Forest will let you issue commands to Kelvin, and you can also give him objects. But the game absolutely will not let you give him weapons. So if you speak to him and ask him to take an item, no weapons will be available.</p><h2>What does the white eye mean Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>It doesn’t mean an enemy is hunting you, it’s a stealth meter. The higher the white bar, the more visible you are. Try wearing leaf armor, you will be nearly invisible.</p><h2>What are the strings in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>Rope in Sons Of The Forest can only be found in specific places, because it is not a naturally occurring resource. The first place to look should be the suitcases and crates dotted about your spawn point, as these will sometimes contain Rope that you can use for very early crafting.</p><h2>Why can’t Kelvin fight in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>Can Kelvin fight in Sons of the Forest? No, Kelvin cannot fight in Sons of the Forest. There is no way to give Kelvin a weapon, so he’ll simply try to evade attacks during combat. If you’re wondering why Kelvin can’t fight, it’s because the crash made him deaf and put him in a bit of a daze.</p><h2>Are there Jumpscares in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news but there are actually a couple jumpscares especially if you intend to visit caves. Heck even while minding your own business and building your base there might be some enemies managing to sneak up on and surprise attack you.</p><h2>Is Sons of the Forest creepy?</h2><p>There’s a lot to be scared of in Endnight Games’ latest Steam Early Access project – but it’s the digits that do me in. Sons of the Forest is not for the faint of heart. There are corpses, cannibals, a breed of mutant whose entire torso is a row of teeth, and a whole range of other terrors.</p><h2>Who is Kelvin in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>Kelvin is king in Sons Of The Forest. An ally who survives the helicopter crash at the start of the game, Kelvin is your first companion in Sons of the Forest, and he’s incredibly useful.</p><h2>Who is the girl with 4 arms in Sons of the Forest?</h2><p>A mysterious, mutated heiress to a massive fortune, Virginia in Sons Of The Forest is an odd and sympathetic character.
