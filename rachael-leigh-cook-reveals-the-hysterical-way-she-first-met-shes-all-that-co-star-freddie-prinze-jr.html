The first time I met Freddie was in Sundance,” <strong>Rachael</strong> shared with <a href=#>E!</a>. “We were both in House of Yes and I was in a house that he and Parker [Posey] and Josh [Hamilton] and everybody were in just saying hello to everybody.”</p><p>“I was standing in the living room and I felt these giant arms just throw themselves around me and hug me and rest a chin on top of my head,” <strong>Rachael</strong> continued. “And it was Freddie and he just goes, ‘Hey babe.’ I looked up and he screamed a little because he thought I was [his then-girlfriend] Kimberly [McCullough]. He didn’t know that it was me because why would you? We had the exact same frame and hair color. So it was a pretty hilarious, romantic-comedy first meeting that obviously never became a real romance, but it was pretty funny.”</p><p>After the movie was released, <strong>Rachael</strong> and <strong>Freddie</strong> lost touch for years, but reconnected after their co-star <a href=# title="Paul Walker"><strong>Paul Walker</strong></a> died in 2013 in a car accident.</p><p>“He’s just such a wonderful human. I just love that guy,” <strong>Rachael</strong> added about <strong>Freddie</strong>. “But I probably didn’t talk to him again until a couple of years after Pauldied and realized you really have to reach out and take some initiative.</p><p>She added, “So we got coffee and I remember saying to him, ‘I know we never really hung out very much after the shoot, but you have no idea what a big part of my life this ended up being.’ And he said something very Freddie-like, ‘Me too, dude. It’s crazy.’ But I’m so lucky that it’s someone as charming and as lovely as Freddie to share that with.”</p><p>In He’s All That, <strong>Rachael</strong> reprised her role as Laney, mom to <a href=# title="Addison Rae"><strong>Addison Rae</strong></a>‘s lead character Padgett. The film is available for streaming on Netflix now.</p><p><span>Just Jared on Facebook</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqpGYtaKxy2ajnqGXnXqku86kZKudppqurb%2BMrZ%2BeZZiuwLWx0aKamqRdrK66edKhnGaemafAtXnMnqtmq5iawG6ty6VkraCRqXqku4ysq5qqXZu%2FprDDopxmqKKeu7uxjKOpaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
