Consisting of five brothers, Albert, Otto, Alfred, Charles, and John, the Ringling Brothers eventually set up operations in Chicago to avoid directly competing with the Barnum and Bailey Circus in New York. The <a href=# rel=noopener>two circuses</a> eventually combined and continued on until 2017.</p><h2>1897: Oscar Wilde Is Released From Prison</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Oscar Wilde</a> is released from Reading Gaol prison in Berkshire, England. Two years earlier, Wilde had been found guilty of “gross indecency” and sodomy, then sentenced to hard labor. His time in prison inspired him to write The Ballad of Reading Gaol, but Wilde never recovered and died in 1900 at the age of just 46.</p><h2>1925: Pol Pot Is Born</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-369552 alt="Pol Pot" width=600 height=757 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pol-pot.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-369552 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>Millions of people died in Cambodia as Pol Pot tried to make it into an agrarian utopia.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Pol Pot</a> is born in the Cambodian village of Prek Sbauv. Born Saloth Sar, he rose through the ranks of the Cambodian communist party and eventually took control of the country, which he sought to transform into an agrarian utopia. Roughly 2 million people died under his brutal reign in what’s known as the <a href=# rel=noopener>Cambodian genocide</a>. Following a Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978, Pol Pot’s regime was toppled and forced into the jungles along the border with Thailand for much of the rest of his life before his death at age 72 in 1998.</p><h2>1935: Lawrence Of Arabia Dies</h2><p>Thomas Edward Lawrence, best known as “Lawrence of Arabia” dies at the age of 46 in Dorset, England, following a motorcycle accident. An archaeologist, soldier, and author, Lawrence wrote extensively about his time in the Middle East, where he helped lead the Arab Revolt as well as the Sinai and Palestine Campaign against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. His life — and his book Seven Pillars of Wisdom — inspired the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia.</p><h2>1983: Diane Downs Attempts to Murder Her Three Children</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-369553 alt="Diane Downs And Her Children" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/diane-downs-and-children.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-369553 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Downs Family</span><span class=caption-body>Diane Downs and her three children.</span></p><p><a href=#>Diane Downs</a> attempts to murder her three young children, eight-year-old <a href=# rel=noopener>Christie</a>, seven-year-old Cheryl, and three-year-old Danny, by faking a carjacking.
